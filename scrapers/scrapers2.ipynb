      "H2 Tag Content: Raveena Tandon’s thoughtful gesture at a mass wedding event has won hearts online. The actress gifted her cherished wedding bangles, engraved with her and her husband's names, to a newlywed couple, symbolizing love and blessings.\n",
      "Story Paragraphs: ['Raveena Tandon recently attended a mass wedding event that left social media buzzing with admiration for her thoughtful gesture. A video capturing the moment shows the actress gifting her cherished wedding bangles to a newlywed couple, making the occasion even more special.', 'The event, organized by Mohsin Haider at BMC Chawl, saw Raveena dressed elegantly in a red kurta set with intricate golden embroidery. During the ceremony, she presented the bride and groom with two bangles she had been wearing since her own wedding. Explaining the sentimental value, Raveena shared, “In Punjabi weddings, brides wear a chooda for 40 days. I’ve worn these two bangles since my wedding. I’m gifting the one with my name engraved to the bride and the other, with my husband’s name, to the groom.\"', '', 'The heartfelt moment was met with applause and cheers from the audience. Raveena was seen kissing the bangles before handing them over and embracing the bride warmly, leaving the couple visibly touched by her gesture. Fans quickly took to social media to praise her kindness. One user commented, “Was it real gold? Wow!\" while another wrote, “She is a gem.\" A third fan simply added, “Great job.\"', 'On the professional front, Raveena Tandon was last seen in Ghudchadi, alongside Sanjay Dutt, Parth Samthaan, Khushalii Kumar, and Aruna Irani. The film is currently available for streaming on JioCinema. Up next, she will be seen in Welcome to the Jungle, directed by Anees Bazmee. The ensemble cast includes Akshay Kumar, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sanjay Dutt, Disha Patani, Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Tusshar Kapoor, Shreyas Talpade, Farida Jalal, and Johnny Lever. The film is slated for a theatrical release later this year.']\n",
