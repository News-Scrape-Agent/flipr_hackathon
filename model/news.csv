                                    Maharashtra delegation in Paris to seek UNESCO World Heritage tag for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's forts",2025-02-23T16:20:42+05:30,"UNESCO tag for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj forts:A high-level delegation, headed by Maharashtra Cultural Affairs Minister Ashish Shelar, is in Paris to advocate for UNESCO World Heritage status for 12 forts associated with Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, an official said on Sunday.
According to an official statement from  Shelar's office, the Maharashtra government has submitted a proposal to UNESCO under the theme 'Maratha Military Landscape of India', seeking the inclusion of 12 forts in the World Heritage list.
The forts of Raigad, Rajgad, Pratapgad, Panhala, Shivneri, Lohagad, Salher, Sindhudurg, Suvarnadurg, Vijaydurg, Khanderi and Jinji in Tamil Nadu have been included in the proposal, the statement said.
On the directives of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, a delegation departed for Paris on Saturday to advocate for the state's case for UNESCO recognition.
The four-member delegation, including additional chief secretary Vikas Kharge, deputy director of the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums Hemant Dalvi, and architect Shikha Jain, will be in Paris till February 26.
The delegation will conduct technical and diplomatic presentations before the UNESCO authorities, emphasising the historical and architectural significance of these forts, the statement said.
Shelar conveyed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for forwarding Maharashtra's proposal to UNESCO and to Devendra Fadnavis for entrusting him with the responsibility of representing the state on a global stage.
He expressed hope that these efforts would secure international recognition for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s forts while emphasizing the significance of Maharashtra’s cultural heritage. ""If UNESCO grants recognition to these forts, it will open avenues for enhanced conservation, preservation, and tourism development. This will help safeguard Maharashtra's cultural heritage and boost the local economy,"" Shelar said.

Other than the Punjab film industry, Sonia Mann has acted in films across multiple languages, including Malayalam, Hindi, Telugu, and Marathi. She made her debut with the Malayalam movie 'Hide n' Seek' and later starred in Kahin Hai Mera Pyar, marking her Hindi film debut in 2014. More recently, she appeared in Happy Hardy and Heer in 2020.
Beyond films, she has collaborated with well-known singers, including the late Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewale in 2018.

                                    Vasundhara Oswal, daughter of Indian-origin billionaire, speaks out after ordeal in Ugandan prison",2025-02-23T16:34:37+05:30,"Vasundhara Oswal, the 26-year-old daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal, has opened up about her harrowing ordeal in Uganda, where she was detained for more than three weeks on false charges of kidnapping and attempting to murder a former employee of her father’s company. The accusations were later proven to be unfounded when the supposed victim, Mukesh Menaria, was discovered alive in Tanzania.
Vasundhara Oswal, the daughter of Indian-origin billionaires Pankaj and Radhika Oswal, is a prominent business leader who has made significant strides in the corporate world. Serving as the Executive Director (Finance) of PRO Industries and Director General of Axis Minerals, she oversees major projects, including one of the largest bauxite mining operations in Guinea. Under her leadership, both companies have achieved substantial growth, launched sustainability initiatives, and improved their financial health. Oswal, a graduate in Finance from a prestigious Swiss university, is also known for her contributions to ecological efforts, such as implementing a Zero Liquid Discharge program and a CO2 capture facility. Recognized for her accomplishments, she was named Inspiring Woman of the Year by The Economic Times and awarded the Global Youth Icon Award in 2023. Additionally, she has led social initiatives in East Africa, benefiting underprivileged communities.
Despite her achievements and influential role in the business world, her detention in Uganda was marked by a series of human rights abuses that have shocked her family and supporters.
The controversy began on October 1, 2024, when Vasundhara Oswal was arrested in Uganda, and accused of kidnapping and attempting to murder Menaria. Despite being told that the man was still alive on October 10, she remained incarcerated until October 21, facing brutal conditions during her detention. She was initially kept in a high-security facility alongside convicted murderers and human traffickers. Oswal has now come forward to label her treatment as a ""gross violation of human rights.""
In a recent interview with news agency PTI, Oswal described the conditions she faced while in Ugandan custody. She claimed that she was denied basic necessities like food, water, and access to a washroom. ""My parents had to bribe police officers through lawyers to bring me food, water, and basic necessities,"" she revealed. The situation was even more distressing when she alleged that the police had searched her property without a warrant and coerced her into giving a statement without legal representation. “They said, ‘We are in Uganda; we can do anything; you’re not in Europe anymore,’” Oswal recalled.
Despite submitting a police bond and producing evidence that Menaria was alive, Oswal remained in detention. She was eventually charged with misdemeanor confinement, but Oswal believes the charges were a tactic to extort money from her family. She claims the Ugandan police acted without proper investigation, focusing instead on obtaining bribes. Her passport was held hostage until December 10, 2024, and the legal process only concluded when the charges were dismissed on December 19, 2024.
Oswal’s experience in Uganda has raised serious concerns about the treatment of foreign investors and the legal practices in the country. She called the Ugandan authorities’ actions a direct assault on her human rights, stating that the situation reflects poorly on the country's treatment of international business leaders. “I feel like the other governments have already corrected their mistakes, and they have used the law correctly, not in a manipulative manner,” she said. ""So, this is more up to the Ugandan government to correct its mistakes toward an investor who has spent the last three years in their country building their business.""
Throughout her ordeal, Oswal has garnered support from various international communities. In 2023, she was named ""Inspiring Woman of the Year"" by The Economic Times and recognized as a Global Youth Icon. However, the pain of her detention is still fresh, and she has vowed to explore all legal remedies for the mistreatment she endured during her imprisonment.
As Vasundhara Oswal moves forward, her case serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by foreign investors navigating legal systems that may be prone to corruption or negligence. She has vowed to seek justice for the human rights violations she suffered and hopes that the Ugandan government will take accountability for its actions.

                                    Pakistan’s new Gwadar airport has links to China | Know about the hush-hush inauguration, shocking details ",2025-02-23T12:45:55+05:30,"Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport, entirely  financed by China, is a conundrum built at a steep cost of USD 240 million. With no passengers, no planes and a hush-hush inaugural ceremony, the airport invokes mystery over its construction. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in October 2024, the airport is a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.
However, authorities have hailed it as ""transformational"" but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid — electricity comes from neighboring Iran or solar panels — and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.
The answer: ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan."" ""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specializes in Pakistan-China ties made it very clear.
The inauguration of the Gwadar airport was delayed due to security concerns. There were fears the area's mountains, and their proximity to the airport, could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to the media and public.
Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, district president of the Balochistan Awami Party, said not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, ""not even as a watchman.”
For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.
In December, Gwadar witnessed daily protests over living conditions in the area. The protests stopped 47 days later, once authorities pledged to meet the locals' demands, including better access to electricity and water.
No progress has been made on implementing those demands since then. Without local labour, goods or services, there can be no trickle-down benefit from CPEC, said international relations expert Khalid. As Chinese money came to Gwadar, so did a heavy-handed security apparatus that created barriers and deepened mistrust.
""The Pakistani government is not willing to give anything to the Baloch people, and the Baloch are not willing to take anything from the government,"" said Khalid.

The controversy began after leaked messages from 2023 surfaced, in which St Clair allegedly detailed her plans to ""seduce"" Musk to have his baby.
St Clair, 26, has now reportedly filed for full custody of the child and requested a court-ordered genetic test to confirm Musk's paternity. The influencer also leaked private text messages that she reportedly exchanged with Musk, which have sparked widespread media attention.
The situation took an unexpected turn when fellow MAGA influencer Isabella Moody shared what she claimed were text messages from St Clair. According to Moody, these exchanges, sent in May 2023, showed St Clair's clear intention to have a child with Musk.
According to reports, one of the messages allegedly reads, ""Elon followed me. I need his rocket babies. I'll take one for the team, seduce Elon, and get in a rocket to see what's up."" Another message reportedly showed St Clair asking for advice on how to ""seduce Elon Musk.""
Moody, who shared the texts on social media, stated, ""I wasn't going to post these, but now Ashley has leaked her private messages with Elon Musk after claiming she 'wanted privacy,' here's more proof she planned to baby trap him.""
While Musk has not issued an official statement on the matter, he previously responded to a post on X (formerly Twitter) suggesting that St Clair had been plotting to have his child for years. His response? A single word: ""Whoa.""
St Clair, who insists that their alleged relationship began through direct messages, has now filed a legal request for a court order to confirm the child's paternity. She is also seeking full custody.
Despite the swirling allegations, Musk has remained largely silent, neither confirming nor denying St Clair's claims. The legal battle continues as the influencer pursues her claim for custody and a genetic test to settle the matter.",Worlds LatestNews,,

                                    Italy's Meloni lauds PM Modi, Trump, hits out at 'liberal network': 'All mud they throw at us'",2025-02-23T12:30:19+05:30,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni strongly defended global conservative leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while delivering a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, DC. Speaking via video link on Saturday, Meloni accused the Left of hypocrisy and alleged that they react with ""hysteria"" to the growing influence of right-wing leaders worldwide.
During her address, Meloni expressed admiration for Modi, highlighting his leadership and growing global influence alongside other right-wing figures such as former US President Donald Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei.
""When Bill Clinton and Tony Blair created a global leftist liberal network in the 90s, they were celebrated as statesmen. But when leaders like Trump, myself, (Javier) Milei, or perhaps (Narendra) Modi advocate for conservative policies, we are called threats to democracy,"" Meloni remarked. ""This is the Left’s double standard, but people are no longer fooled by it. Despite their relentless attacks, citizens continue to support us.""
Meloni also praised Trump, calling him a steadfast leader who remains committed to conservative values despite pressure from liberal establishments. ""The Left is nervous, and with Trump's victory, their irritation has turned into hysteria. Not only because conservatives are winning, but because conservatives are now collaborating globally,"" she said.

Her remarks underscored the rising prominence of conservative leaders like Modi, who has positioned India as a major global power while maintaining a strong nationalist agenda. Modi’s leadership has been praised for his economic policies, focus on national security, and efforts to assert India’s role on the world stage.
However, Meloni’s participation in CPAC drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders in Italy, especially following a controversial gesture by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, which some interpreted as a Nazi salute. Calls for her to withdraw from the event grew after Jordan Bardella, leader of France’s National Rally (RN) party, distanced himself from CPAC over the controversy.
Elly Schlein, leader of Italy’s centre-left Democratic Party, condemned Meloni’s association with the event, stating, ""She should disassociate herself from this extremist gathering. She has remained silent about Trump’s attacks on Ukraine and the European Union, failing to stand up for Italy and European interests.""
Despite these criticisms, Meloni defended her stance, emphasizing that transatlantic ties would remain strong under a Trump administration. ""The United States and Europe will continue to stand together under Trump's leadership,"" she assured.
Her remarks come at a time when global politics is witnessing a shift toward right-wing leadership, with figures like Modi playing a key role in shaping international alliances and conservative governance.

                                    Germany elections: Voting underway in high-stake polls to elect new Parliament | All you need to know",2025-02-23T13:38:08+05:30,"The voting for the high-stakes German elections is currently underway to elect the new Bundestag (German Parliament). German voters are heading to polling stations to elect a new parliament that will determine how the country is run for the next four years.
The elections are happening seven months ahead of schedule as the coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed after he lost a confidence vote on December 16, 2024. The Parliament was dissolved by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on December 27. The government collapsed after Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner in early November. The move proved the pinnacle of change as the ruling three-party coalition relied on Lindner’s pro-business party.
The voting starts after polling stations open from 8 am to 6 pm (0700 GMT-1700 GMT). German voters can also exercise their franchise by postal ballot, but their ballot must arrive by the time polling stations close on election day to be counted.
The vote counting will begin immediately after voting ends. The general picture of the outcome is likely to become clear very quickly due to exit polls. However, a final official result is expected early Monday.
In the ongoing elections, four candidates are running to be Germany’s next leader: incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the centre-left Social Democrats; Friedrich Merz of the mainstream conservative Christian Democratic Union party, current Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, and Alice Weidel of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD.
The polls suggest the centre-right opposition Union bloc — the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union — are supposed to win the most seats in the Bundestag, still falling well short of a majority to govern alone. If the poll yields the same, they would need to form a coalition with at least one other party to govern.
The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, is polling strongly. However, it is unlikely that it would become part of the government as other parties have said that they won’t work with it.

According to the Finance Ministry's annual report, ""Currently, seven projects worth a total budget of USD 750 million (approximately INR 6,000 crore) are being implemented by USAID in collaboration with the Government of India."" These projects, which span a range of sectors, were part of a continued partnership between India and the U.S., dating back to 1951. In the 2023-24 fiscal year alone, USAID allocated a total of USD 97 million (about INR 825 crore) for these initiatives.
The Department of Economic Affairs, which handles bilateral funding arrangements, also shared detailed information about the projects funded by USAID in 2023-24. While there was no funding allocated for voter turnout-related projects, the focus was on critical sectors such as agriculture and food security, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), renewable energy, disaster management, and health. Additionally, funds were earmarked for programs related to sustainable forests, climate adaptation, and energy efficiency technology commercialization.
USAID, which has provided over USD 17 billion in assistance to India since its inception, has been involved in more than 555 projects across various sectors, contributing significantly to India's development over the decades.
The political debate surrounding USAID's involvement in India intensified earlier this month after Elon Musk's company, DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), claimed it had cancelled a USD 21 million grant aimed at increasing voter turnout in India. This claim was further amplified by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who repeatedly alleged that USAID under the Biden administration allocated funding to India for the same purpose.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar responded to the allegations, calling the claims ""concerning"" and emphasising that the government was looking into the matter. He reassured that USAID's presence in India was welcomed ""in good faith,"" with the agency initially being permitted to carry out activities for developmental purposes. Jaishankar expressed concerns over suggestions that some activities were not conducted in good faith, especially in light of the recent allegations.
The controversy also prompted a strong response from the opposition, particularly the Congress party. Congress leaders accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of spreading ""fake news"" from the United States and taking part in ""anti-national work."" Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh criticized the BJP for jumping to conclusions based on unverified information, adding that the USD 21 million grant was intended for voter turnout projects in Bangladesh, not India. Ramesh also aimed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Jaishankar, questioning their silence in the face of repeated allegations from figures like Trump and Musk.
Ramesh remarked, ""The BJP is a procession of liars and illiterates. The USD 21 million grant was never intended for voter turnout in India but for Bangladesh. The BJP must explain why it is amplifying such baseless claims.""
As the political debate continues, the issue highlights the challenges surrounding foreign aid and its potential influence on domestic political processes. Both the Indian government and USAID will likely face further scrutiny as the situation unfolds, and the government may need to address the broader implications of foreign funding on Indian elections.
This ongoing controversy underscores the complexity of international aid, particularly when it intersects with sensitive issues like national elections. With both political parties in India voicing strong opinions, the government’s response will be closely watched as it works to resolve the situation and maintain transparency in its dealings with foreign agencies.

Earlier, the 6th Pay Commission applied a fitment factor of 1.86.
According to reports, the fitment factor this time could range between 2.28 and 2.86. So if a person is getting a basic salary of 18,000, the revised basic salary is expected to be Rs 51,480 (considering the upper range of the fitment factor). If we consider the lower range of the fitment factor, the basic salary is expected to be around Rs 46,260.
It means the basic salary of the government employees is expected to be above Rs 40,000.
So government employees can expect a major salary boost after the implementation of the 8th Pay Commission,
Why does the government form Pay Commissions?
The government forms a Pay Commission to review and recommend adjustments in the salaries of government employees and pensions of those who have retired. It makes recommendations keeping in view the inflation and other economic conditions.",Business LatestNews,,

                                    IT sector salary hikes this year might be 'cautious' this year amid economic uncertainties: Experts ",2025-02-23T13:56:30+05:30,"The salary increments in India’s IT service sectors are projected to be moderate in the fiscal year 2025, as companies navigate a complex landscape of global economic uncertainties, evolving skill demands, and the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), according to experts.
Industry experts predict an average wage increase of 4 to 8.5 per cent, a notable step down from previous years, signalling a shift towards more pragmatic compensation strategies.
""The outlook for salary hikes this year is quite cautious,"" noted Krishna Vij, VP, TeamLease Digital. ""Industry players are looking at increments in the 4 per cent to 8.5 per cent range, which is lower than what we've seen in previous years. This slowdown is largely due to global economic challenges, reduced discretionary spending, and shifting business priorities,” he noted.
Companies are being more conservative with their salary budgets, and many have even pushed their appraisal cycles beyond the usual April-June period, she said, which has made salary revisions less predictable in the current scenario.
""Organisations are shifting to skills-based pay, leveraging Tier II hiring for cost efficiency. Instead of salary hikes, retention bonuses, ESOPs, and project-based incentives are being implemented as compensation strategies,"" Vij said.
Reed & Willow CEO Janoo Motiani also gave a similar expected hike range, pegging it between 5 to 8.5 per cent.
""The days of double-digit hikes seem behind us--at least for now. The industry is settling into a more pragmatic rhythm, with average hikes expected to hover between 5 per cent and 8.5 per cent.
This aligns with the cautious optimism seen across the sector. TCS has taken the lead, announcing hikes ranging from 4-8 per cent effective April 2025, setting the tone for the rest of the industry. However, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra are holding off on final announcements, likely waiting to gauge market movements in Q2 before locking in their plans,"" she shared.
While this might seem like a conservative approach, she said, it reflects the market reality--tempered growth, the rise of AI-led efficiencies, and shifting client demands are influencing how companies allocate compensation budgets.

In a recent move, the government instructed all telecom operators across the country to register anyone involved in issuing SIM cards to customers. Although this directive isn't new, the deadline for compliance has been extended to March 31, 2025.
This updated directive aims to tighten the rules surrounding SIM issuance to combat cyber fraud effectively. Additionally, the government plans to take action against individuals who have more than 9 SIM SIM cards registered in their name.
Under the new regulations, telecom companies must register their agents, franchisees, and SIM card distributors. This introduces an added layer of transparency and security in the SIM issuance process in India. So far, private telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel have completed their registrations, while Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) still has some catching up to do.
To assist BSNL, the government has granted an additional two months for them to register their SIM dealers. Starting April 1, 2025, only registered SIM card distributors will be authorized to provide SIMs to customers.

Initially, it was thought that this smartphone would launch as the iPhone SE 4, but that did not happen. Instead, Apple has included this new device in the iPhone 16 series. Although it is the most affordable iPhone offered by the company, its price in Pakistan may come as a surprise.
In India, the iPhone 16e has been launched at a starting price of Rs 59,900. While it is considered a budget-friendly option, the pricing turned out to be slightly higher than expected. In Pakistan, to purchase the base model of this latest iPhone, you'll need to fork out over one and a half lakh rupees.
The tech giant has released the iPhone 16e in three storage variants: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, all with 8GB of RAM. In India, the price of the 128GB variant is set at Rs 59,900, while the 256GB variant costs Rs 69,900, and the 512GB variant comes in at Rs 89,900.
When it comes to the price of the iPhone 16e in Pakistan, things are a bit steeper. For the base variant, you'll have to spend about 1,67,000 Pakistani rupees. The 256GB version will set you back 1,95,000 Pakistani rupees, and if you opt for the top-tier 512GB model, prepare to pay around 2,51,000 Pakistani rupees. The significant price increase for iPhones in Pakistan can largely be attributed to the declining value of the Pakistani rupee against the dollar, making it considerably more expensive compared to prices in India.
Let’s take a look at the iPhone 16e's pricing in various countries. In the USA, the starting price is USD 599, which roughly translates to about Rs 52,063. Launched in Dubai, the base model retails for AED 2,599, or around Rs 61,476. In Canada, it is priced at CAD 899, approximately Rs 54,926.

Kohli has shattered the record of former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin for taking the most catches by a fielder in ODI cricket. He was earlier tied with Azharuddin on 156 catches each. Kohli has gone past the former Indian skipper with his 157th catch in the clash against Pakistan.
Kohli achieved the feat when he took the catch of Naseem Shah offKuldeep Yadavin the 47th over of Pakistan's batting innings. Naseem chipped one towards long-on as Kohli charged in from the fence to take a good low-catch.
Most catches as fielder for India in ODIs:
Virat Kohli - 158*
Mohd Azharuddin - 156
Sachin Tendulkar- 140
Rahul Dravid - 124
Suresh Raina- 102
After taking his 157th catch, Kohli took another catch which saw Pakistan getting dismissed for 241. Khushdil Shah slogged a ball from Harshit Rana in the 50th over towards deep mid-wicket, where Kohli was present and held on to the chance easily.
The Men in Green have put up a middling total in Dubai. Saud Shakeel was the highest scorer for them, having made 62 from 76 balls. Mohammad Rizwan and Shakeel had put up a 104-run stand for the third wicket after both the openers departed inside the powerplay.

""Doesn't really matter, they won the toss so we'll bowl first. Looks similar to the last game, the surface is on the slower side. We have an experienced unit in batting so we know what we need to do if the pitches get slower. Need an overall performance from the team - with bat and ball.

The game began with Pakistan coming in to bat first after winning the toss.
The Men in Green opened their innings withBabar AzamandImam-ul-Haqcoming out to bat. Both batters hoped to propel Pakistan to a good start to the clash. However, it was Babar Azam who captured the limelight with his performance.
The star batter scored 23 runs in 26 deliveries before he fell prey toHardik Pandya. However, despite his short-lived innings, Babar Azam managed to achieve a huge personal milestone. Through his 23-run knock, Babar completed 1000 runs in ICC ODI events, which include the Champions Trophy and the ODI World Cup. It is worth noting that the 30-year-old achieved the feat in his 24th innings in ICC ODI events and has now amassed 1014 runs to his name in the tournaments.
Achieving his personal milestone, Babar's knock failed to help Pakistan. The star batter departed for just 23 runs, which provided the Indian team with just the start that they needed. Furthermore, Pakistan went on to lose their second wicket shortly after Babar's dismissal as well. Axar Patel’s excellence in the field and a direct run-out saw Imam-ul-Haq walk back to the pavilion as well.Read AlsoIND vs PAK: Axar Patel's excellent fielding catches Imam-ul-Haq short in Dubai | WatchMohammed Shami equals unwanted record after bowling 11-ball over vs Pakistan in Champions TrophyHardik Pandya gives cold send-off to Babar Azam after getting him in Champions Trophy clash | WATCH

Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss and opted to bat first. The Men in Green were off to a fine start withBabar AzamandImam-ul-Haqputting a 43-run stand for the opening wicket before both of them departed in quick succession.
Babar Azam was sent back to the hut byHardik Pandya, nicking one behind and getting caught byKL Rahul. Imam was run out in the very next over and the Men in Green were suddenly in a hole.
Captain Rizwan and Saud Shakeel put in the hard yards to rebuild things for the team. In a not-a-friendly incident, Rizwan and Harshit collided with each other.
The incident occurred in the 21st over, when Harshit was into the second over of his second spell. Rizwan pulled the Indian speedster to deep square leg, and as he was running, the two had a shoulder barge in the middle of the crease. Harshit did not look happy about the incident and raised his arms, wondering what the Pakistan skipper was doing.
Watch the incident here:

Rizwan had won the toss and had opted to bat first. The Men in Green made one change to the Playing XI which lost its opening clash of the tournament against New Zealand with Ima coming in for the injuredFakhar Zaman.

                                    Do you use scented wax melts? Study says it can release toxic particles in indoor air",2025-02-23T12:56:16+05:30,"A new research found that aroma compounds released from the scented wax melts can react with ozone in indoor air to form potentially toxic particles. This challenges the belief that scented wax melts are safer than combustion-based candles. The study was published in the ACS’ Environmental Science & Technology Letters.
There have been previous researches that have shown that scented wax melts emit more airborne scent compounds than traditional candles. According to the new study, the direct heating of the wax maximises its surface area which releases more fragrance such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) made of hydrocarbons – into the air.
Researchers know that these chemicals can react with other compounds in the air to form nanometer-wide particles which have been linked to negative health effects when inhaled. However, the potential for nanoparticle formation during wax-melt use was unknown.
So, Nusrat Jung, Brandon Boor and colleagues from Purdue University in the US set out to investigate this process using wax melts in a full-scale house model that mimicked a typical residential house. The researchers conducted experiments on 15 commercially available wax melts, both unscented and scented ( lemon, papaya, tangerine and peppermint), in the model house.
They first established a baseline of indoor air pollutants and then switched on the wax warmer for about 2 hours. During and after this period, the researchers continuously sampled the air a few yards (meters) away from the wax melts and found airborne nanoparticles, between 1 and 100 nanometers wide at levels that were comparable to previously reported levels for traditional, combustion-based candles.
The researchers said, ""These particles could pose an inhalation risk because they are small enough to pass through respiratory tissues and enter the bloodstream.""
The team also calculated that a person could inhale similar amounts of nanoparticles from wax melts as from traditional candles and gas stoves.
In the experiments, the main VOCs emitted from the wax melts were terpenes, such as monoterpenes and monoterpenoids. The researchers identified that the airborne terpenes reacted with ozone and formed sticky compounds, which aggregated into nanoscale particles.
However, after warming an unscented wax melt, the team observed no terpene emissions or nanoparticle formation, which suggests that these aroma compounds contribute to nanoparticle formation.

You can prepare smoothie packs with fresh strawberries and other fruits (bananas, blueberries, spinach) and freeze them in individual servings. Whenever you crave a smoothie, just blend a pack with some milk, juice or yoghurt.
Strawberry syrup is super easy to make with fresh or frozen strawberries, sugar and a little lemon juice. You can store it in the fridge for weeks. Pour it over pancakes, waffles or ice cream.

The festival is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is celebrated on the Chaturdashi Tithi during Krishna Paksha in the month of Magh, according to the South Indian calendar and Phalgun, according to the North Indian calendar.
People fast on the day of Maha Shivratri and worship the lord to attain his blessings. When you're fasting for Maha Shivratri, you can eat certain foods as it helps to maintain your energy levels. While a lot of people choose to eat healthy foods, you can also opt for traditional fasting foods. Here are some traditional foods you can eat during Maha Shivratri fast.
Sabudana (tapioca pearls) is a popular fasting ingredient due to its light, easy-to-digest nature which also provides quick energy. Sabudana khichdi is made by soaking tapioca pearls and then sautéing them with ghee, cumin, potatoes and peanuts. This dish is both filling and comforting, making it a go-to for those fasting on Maha Shivratri.
Kuttu flour, made from buckwheat is a staple during fasting as it is considered a gluten-free grain alternative. Kuttu ki puris are deep-fried flatbreads made from this flour and they are often paired with a simple potato curry. This dish is hearty, rich in fibre and is a savoury option.
This is a refreshing and nutritious dish that is made with fresh fruits like apples, bananas, pomegranates and papayas which are then tossed with rock salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon. It’s a great option to break the monotony of heavier fasting foods.
Lassi is a popular drink made with yoghurt which is then flavoured with spices like cumin or cardamom or sweetened with honey or sugar.

                                    Springs fashion: Here's how you can wear pastels without looking too sweet",2025-02-23T16:26:59+05:30,"Spring is here! It is time to move out your winter clothes and add colour to your wardrobe. You can pack away your blacks, greys and tans and swap them with bright colours. However, if you don't like bright colours, you can always wear pastels. There's a shade of pastel for everyone and it's time you find yours if you haven't already.
A lot of people think that wearing pastels will make others perceive them differently. They might appear to be too soft or sweet but that is not the case. It is important that you style it well and it will give the perfect spring vibe while also being bold. Here are different ways you can wear pastels without looking sweet.
Pastels can sometimes feel delicate or overly ""soft,"" but pairing them with bolder or darker tones can add contrast and give the outfit more edge. For example, a pastel pink blouse with black leather pants or a mint green dress with a dark navy jacket can balance the look.
Combine pastels with edgier textures and materials such as leather, denim or silk. A pastel shirt paired with a leather mini skirt or a pastel blouse tucked into distressed jeans creates a more balanced and stylish outfit with a twist.
Too many frilly or delicate accessories can make a pastel outfit overly sweet. Instead, opt for sleek and minimal accessories in neutral or metallic tones. A pair of gold or silver hoop earrings, a simple black bag or even a bold watch will allow the pastel colour to stand out.
Wearing pastels in a monochrome or colour-blocked fashion can give the colours more power. For example, wearing an all-pastel ensemble like a pastel yellow top with pastel yellow trousers, looks sleek and intentional. Alternatively, you can use colour-blocking with pastels and other bold colours.
Pastels don’t have to be limited to solid colours. Incorporating prints and patterns like stripes, checks or even abstract designs can add an edge to your look. For example, a pastel floral blouse with bold geometric patterns or pastel stripes combined with a neutral-coloured blazer will make the pastels feel more contemporary.

American swimmer Michael Phelps said, ""The problem with heart disease is that the first symptom is often fatal."" This also highlights that it is often difficult to diagnose the condition early if people are only dependent on the symptoms.
Sometimes the first sign of heart disease is chest pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath, numbness and pain in the legs and arms which is eventually followed by a heart attack. A lot of times heart attacks can turn out to be fatal. Other times, people are diagnosed with heart disease. However, if an individual undergoes regular check-ups, such conditions can be diagnosed and one can seek treatment for the same. After a certain age (40 years), it is important that people undertake certain tests at regular intervals to keep a check on their heart health. Here are some tests to check your heart health.
This test involves exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike while your heart's activity is monitored through an ECG (electrocardiogram). The goal is to assess how your heart responds to physical stress. It helps detect coronary artery disease, irregular heart rhythms and how your heart functions under stress, giving doctors important information about your heart’s fitness.
An ultrasound of the heart that uses sound waves to create images of the heart’s structure and assess how well the heart is pumping blood. It helps detect heart valve problems, heart failure, blood clots and other abnormalities.
An ECG records the electrical activity of the heart through sensors placed on the chest. It can detect issues like arrhythmias, heart attacks or structural problems in the heart. It is a non-invasive test that helps identify heart rhythm irregularities, signs of previous heart attacks and other heart conditions early on.
Regular blood pressure readings can be taken at home or in a clinic to track blood pressure levels over time. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a significant risk factor for heart disease. Monitoring blood pressure regularly can help manage the risk.
Blood tests measure cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol) and triglycerides. These tests can also check for other markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) that indicate inflammation. High levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides increase the risk of plaque buildup in arteries, leading to heart disease.
A procedure in which a contrast dye is injected into the coronary arteries via a catheter to visualise blockages or narrowing of the arteries using X-ray imaging. It is the most accurate test for detecting coronary artery disease. If blockages are found, doctors might recommend treatment options like stenting or bypass surgery.
A non-invasive imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart’s structure, tissue and blood flow. It gives high-resolution images that can reveal heart muscle damage, congenital heart defects and the health of heart valves. It's particularly useful for assessing heart disease, cardiomyopathy and the impact of previous heart attacks.

                                    Kidney damage symptoms: 5 signs of the chronic kidney disease you should watch out",2025-02-22T13:17:54+05:30,"Your kidneys are one of the most important organs of the body. It helps to filter out the waste and maintains the functioning of the body. Therefore, it is crucial that you take the necessary steps that maintain kidney health. However, there are several factors that lead to kidney damage and spotting the symptoms of the condition at an early stage can help prevent further damage.
Here are some signs of chronic kidney disease you should keep a watch on.
Increased or decreased urination, especially at night (nocturia) or changes in urine colour (cloudy, foamy, or blood-tinged urine). The kidneys help filter and balance the body's fluids. Any disruption in their function may result in noticeable changes in urine output and consistency.
Persistent tiredness, feeling sluggish or lacking energy despite adequate rest can be a sign of CKD. As kidney function declines, waste products and toxins can build up in the body, leading to feelings of exhaustion. Anaemia which is common in CKD can also contribute to fatigue due to a lack of red blood cells.
Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs or around the eyes. Impaired kidney function affects the body’s ability to remove excess salt and water which leads to fluid retention. This causes swelling, particularly in the lower extremities or face.
Blood pressure readings are consistently higher than normal (above 130/80 mmHg). High blood pressure can be both a cause and a consequence of kidney disease. The kidneys play a role in regulating blood pressure and as they become damaged, it can lead to higher pressure levels, which in turn further damages the kidneys.
Difficulty breathing, feeling winded even after minimal exertion or unexplained shortness of breath. Fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) can occur when the kidneys are no longer efficiently removing excess fluid. This leads to breathing difficulties and is a sign of worsening kidney function.

                                    Blood pressure medicine can be a safer alternative to treat ADHD symptoms; says study",2025-02-21T23:03:09+05:30,"A recent study found that a blood pressure medication may be a safer choice for treating symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The study published in Neuropsychopharmacology said that repurposing amlodipine which is a commonly used blood pressure medicine can help to manage symptoms of ADHD.
The study included researchers from the University of Surrey. The researchers tested five potential drugs in rats bred to exhibit ADHD-like symptoms. Among them, only amlodipine significantly reduced hyperactivity.
To confirm the results, the researchers tested amlodipine in zebrafish which is an important model for studying brain function sharing about 70% of genes with humans.
The results revealed that amlodipine also reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity which are core symptoms of ADHD in these fish. Further analysis revealed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier for the first time which means it can directly influence brain function.
The researchers also found that human ADHD is linked to the same calcium channels in the brain as the targets for amlodipine. This suggests a potential target brain pathway for treatments. Lastly, an analysis of UK-wide patient data showed that people taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and less risk-taking behaviour.
Dr Matthew Parker, co-author of the study from the University of Surrey, said, ""Repurposing amlodipine, a well-established blood pressure medication, offers a promising and swift pathway to address ADHD symptoms. Our research indicates that, due to its existing approval and safety profile, amlodipine could be rapidly redeployed as a treatment option for ADHD, potentially providing relief to patients sooner than developing new medications.""
Around 25% of patients do not respond well to any current ADHD medication, highlighting the urgent need for new treatment options. Amlodipine which is already widely used and well-tolerated, could offer a new and safer treatment option for ADHD.

                                    Measles outbreak Texas: 90 cases confirmed; symptoms and preventive measures",2025-02-22T19:39:59+05:30,"The Texas Department of State Health Services said that 90 cases of measles have been confirmed in northwest Texas. The outbreak which began in late January has reported the highest the highest number of cases, 32, since Tuesday. Of these, 16 patients have been hospitalized. The health department has said that most of these cases have been reported in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccine status is known.
Speaking to NBC News, Tonya Guffey, the chief nursing officer at Seminole District Hospital in Gaines County said, ""We have a high, high number of unvaccinated. It’s not that they’re not educated. It’s just what their belief is.""
Most of the cases that have been reported are in children and teenagers. 26 of these cases in children under 4 years and 51 in those between the age of 5 and 17.
Measles is a highly contagious disease that is caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death. The infection can affect anyone but is most common in children. Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body.
Earlier, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins said to CBS News, ""It is troubling because this was completely preventable.
""What we're seeing is, one of the places in Texas — it has the lowest vaccination rates, the highest school exemption rates from measles vaccination — having a measles outbreak, including hospitalizations of individuals who've been infected with measles.""
Here are some of the common symptoms of measles
Sensitivity to light.
You might also notice that a few days after the symptoms, there's a red, blotchy rash that spreads from your face to the rest of the body. These rashes can last about seven to 10 days.
Cleveland Clinic says that symptoms of measles usually develop about eight to 12 days after you're exposed to the measles. However, it can also take up to 21 days to develop symptoms after exposure.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) says, ""Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.""
There are two different types of vaccines that provides protection against measles. One of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and the other is the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV) vaccine.

                                    Diabetes Symptoms: 5 signs of high blood sugar you can spot on your face",2025-02-23T13:48:47+05:30,"Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects 14% of adults aged 18 years and older, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). If an individual suffers from diabetes, they have high blood sugar levels. One develops the condition when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body can't use the insulin produced by the pancreas effectively.
If the condition is not managed, diabetes can lead to several health complications such as chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, nerve damage and heart disease among others. If diabetes is diagnosed at an early stage, it can be managed with the right diet, physical activity and medication. However, for the condition to be diagnosed, it is important that you spot the early symptoms. The signs of diabetes can be spotted in different parts of your body. Here, take a look at some of the signs of diabetes that you can spot on your face.
Elevated blood sugar can cause inflammation which may result in puffiness or redness in the face. The face may appear bloated, especially around the eyes and cheeks. This is due to the body retaining water to cope with the increased glucose levels.
When blood sugar levels are too high, the body starts to break down fat for energy, leading to the production of ketones. These ketones can cause a fruity or acetone-like smell on your breath. This is a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which can happen when blood sugar is severely high.
High blood sugar can impair your skin's ability to retain moisture. This can result in dry, flaky or itchy skin, especially on the face. The body's dehydration from high blood sugar also reduces sweat and oil production, further affecting skin hydration.
A condition called Acanthosis Nigricans causes dark and velvety patches of skin to appear, often around the neck, armpits and sometimes the face. This can be a sign of insulin resistance which occurs due to high blood sugar levels. These patches might appear on the sides of the face or around the jawline.
Consistently high blood sugar levels can affect liver function and in some cases, can lead to a yellowish tint in the skin, particularly around the face. This happens because high sugar levels can overload the liver, affecting its ability to process waste properly.

                                    Tesla's India EV sales target April launch, showrooms coming soon",2025-02-19T17:56:27+05:30,"Elon Musk's Tesla is rumoured to be making its way into the Indian electric vehicle (EV) market after facing several challenges, including difficulties with local manufacturing, regulations, and high taxes. Recent news suggests that Tesla is planning to launch its cars in India soon, starting with some imported models expected to arrive by April. They have also found potential locations for their first showrooms, likely in Delhi and Mumbai.
According to reports, the first Tesla cars available in India will mostly come from their factory in Berlin. In the past, the company has been actively pushing for better policies and lower import taxes to make their cars more accessible. The company aims to sell their initial model for under USD 25,000, which is around Rs 22 lakh, to compete with other brands like BYD. Currently, Tesla's cheapest model—the Model 3—sells for about USD 40,000, which is roughly Rs 35 lakh.
Plans are in motion to open two Tesla showrooms in India, one in Aerocity, Delhi, and the other in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Mumbai, with those locations expected to start operating soon. This effort is part of Tesla's broader plan to hire staff for its Indian operations, including service technicians, customer service roles, and delivery specialists.
On the financial side, the Indian government recently lowered the basic customs duty on imported vehicles priced above USD 40,000 from a whopping 125 percent to 70 percent. This change might make it easier for companies like Tesla to sell their cars in India. However, US President Donald Trump had previously criticised the high import taxes in India, which could affect American car sales in the market.
While Tesla hasn't officially confirmed plans to manufacture cars in India yet, reports indicate that they intend to buy components worth over USD 1 billion from India this year, with possibilities for even more sourcing in the future.

This model reveals aesthetic enhancements and modifications in its feature set, particularly in the mid-spec variant. The introductory pricing for the motorcycle begins at Rs 1.35 lakh (ex-showroom).
In terms of design, the 2025 TVS Ronin retains a visual identity reminiscent of its predecessor, characterized by a round headlamp paired with a T-shaped daytime running light (DRL) and a similarly styled fuel tank complemented by a single-piece seat. Notably, the motorcycle is now offered in two additional color scheme options: Glacier Silver and Charcoal Ember.
Furthermore, the incorporation of dual-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) in the mid-spec DS variant marks a significant upgrade, as this feature was previously exclusive to the higher-end TD variant.

Notably, the vehicle is equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, facilitating call and SMS notification alerts. These features are further augmented by the integration of SmartXonnect technology, which offers extensive connectivity capabilities.

This engine is calibrated to deliver a performance output of 20.1 horsepower and a peak torque of 19.93 Nm. The generated power is transmitted to the rear wheel via a 5-speed transmission system, ensuring efficient power delivery and an enhanced riding experience.
The Ronin serves as a strategic representation of TVS Motor Company's entry into the neo-retro motorcycle segment, positioning it as a competitor against models such as the Royal Enfield Hunter 350 and various others available in the Indian marketplace.

                                    Trade, tariffs, immigration: How PM Modi-Trump meeting crucial for India’s bilateral relationship | Explained ",2025-02-13T08:03:03+05:30,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday arrived in the US for a two-day visit. His visit to the US comes at the invitation of US President Donald Trump. India's Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra and other officials welcomed PM Modi at the airport. Interestingly, this is PM Modi's first visit to the United States after Donald Trump assumed office for the second term. During his visit, PM Modi will hold a meeting with US President Trump.
This time the official visit of PM Modi to the US makes it crucial as he is the fourth foreign leader to be hosted by the White House since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2025. More significantly, this is the earliest visit by an Indian Prime Minister in the presidency of any US President in the near past.
PM Modi's visit to the White House comes as Trump is in the fourth week of his second presidency. From the time of inauguration, Trump has met only Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, and Jordan's King Abdullah.
President Trump is taking additional action to upset the world trade system, with plans to sign an order this week that would require that US tariffs on imports match the tax rates charged by other countries. Notably, the trade tariffs are another major irritant in his relationship as Trump has imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and has described India as a ""tariff king"" and ""abuser"" of tariffs.
Recently, Trump has also announced a 25% tariff on aluminium and steel imports with “no exemptions, no exceptions” for any country.
In the wake of these developments, several Indian companies are expressing concerned about the impact of these tariffs on domestic steel prices and the risk of losing out in the US steel market. It should be noted that India has already slashed tariffs on high-end motorcycles and electric batteries ahead of PM Modi's visit.
During their visit, these two leaders are expected to discuss expanded spending on defense equipment and potentially announce new deals. PM Modi can also point to recent reductions in Indian tariffs on high-end American motorcycles and the prospect of lower duties on goods like bourbon and pecans, which are produced mainly in Republican states.
Another key issue that may be discussed during PM Modi's visit is the humane treatment of Indian deportees. Recently, the US sent back a first batch of 104 Indian illegal immigrants, and another 800 individuals are expected to be deported soon. In this regard, the Indian government has registered concerns over the mistreatment of its citizens and is seeking assurances from the US.
Right now, there are over 7.25 lakh immigrants in the US, of which about 20,000 are identified for deportation. Hence, this time, the PM Modi-Trump meet would hope to ensure the legal channels for Indians to move to the US for study, work or tourism remains clear.

In 2023, PM Modi paid an official visit to France as the Guest of Honour at the French National Day.
India and France collaborate on several crucial issues, including defence & security, civil nuclear matters, space, and others. New Delhi and Paris also are each other's strategic partners in the realm of maritime security, cybersecurity, counter-terrorism, climate change, as well as renewable and sustainable growth.
In his current visit to France, the PM will set forth the collaboration with France in motion, as he will preside over the third edition of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit with Macron. Earlier, the summits on AI have taken place in the United Kingdom (2023) and South Korea (2024).
The PM will also review the progress on the 2047 Horizon Roadmap for the India-France strategic partnership along with Macron. The PM, during his visit to France in 2023, adopted a roadmap with Macron, named ‘Horizon 2047’. This roadmap has set the course for the next 25 years, which will mark 100 years of India's independence and diplomatic relations between both countries.
PM Modi will visit the Mazargues War Cemetery, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Marseille. He, along with Macron, will pay tribute to the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers in World War I.
In what can be termed as further strengthening of ties between both countries, both leaders will inaugurate the newest Consulate General of India in Marseille.
In a mark of strong India-France relations in the field of nuclear energy, the PM will pay a visit to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project. Notably, India is also a member of the consortium of partner countries, including France, to harness energy for the betterment of the world.
India and France also share strong defence ties, as France has been a provider of crucial weaponry to India, including the Rafale and Mirage 2000 fighter jets. India also benefits from France's expertise in manufacturing equipment for the navy, with both countries already collaborating over a deal between France's Naval Group and Mumbai's Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders under the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative of PM Modi.

                                    KIIT University row: Outrage over Nepali student death; what rights foreigner students get in India ",2025-02-18T14:23:56+05:30,"Odisha's Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) is in the news for the wrong reason. The institute has been under fire since the demise of a 20-year-old Nepali student at the private engineering institute. She allegedly died by suicide in her hostel, leading to campus tension, following which a group of students from Nepal were evicted on Monday which fuelled the controversy further. However, the management, later, allowed the students to stay in the hostel.
The deceased, identified as Prakriti Lamsal, was a third-year BTech student studying at KIIT. As the situation escalated on campus, KIIT authorities allegedly evicted several Nepali students from the hostel and dropped them at Cuttack railway station without making any arrangements for their travel.
The alleged eviction of Nepali students triggered an outrage on social media, prompting a reaction from Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. On Monday, Oli posted on Facebook in Nepali, ""It has come to our attention through media and social media that a Nepali student has died in a hostel of KIIT University in Odisha and that Nepali students have been forcibly evicted. The government is working on this matter through diplomatic channels and is in contact with the relevant authorities.""
Meanwhile, two officers from the Nepal embassy in Delhi are likely to visit a private engineering institute in Odisha. The officers are also expected to meet a group of students from the Himalayan kingdom, who were allegedly evicted from their hostel.
In the last couple of years, India emerged as an education hub in the South Asian region, offering quality education at a cheaper rate, compared to Western countries. Students in a large number come to India to study from neighbouring countries like Nepal, Afghanistan and Bhutan. Youngsters from African countries also arrive in India. The presence of foreign students in India shows the prowess of India as a soft power. But, incidents like KIIT University row dent the image of the country.
To avoid trouble in India, foreign students must know the basic law meant for them. These laws provide a shield to them against any unwanted incident.
Indian laws provide enough safeguards for the students from outside. India is a member of United Nations (UN), so, foreign students are entitled to practice all the rights given to foreigners under Human rights in the UN Charter.
Foreign students in India have the right to access education in Indian universities and colleges upon fulfilling eligibility criteria. They are entitled to basic rights like the privacy of academic records, legal representation if needed, and the ability to seek assistance from their institution's international office if they encounter legal issues. They have also access to their respective country's embassy in India.",Explainer LatestNews,,

                                    Russia, US mending ties likely to yield good results for India: Five things that can go in New Delhi's favour",2025-02-19T17:33:21+05:30,"As American foreign policy palpably shifts away from its traditional stance of isolating Russia, the world order is likely to witness a rejig. India, being one of the prominent emerging powers, is also taking close note of the development between heavyweights and is likely to shape its policy to conform with the redesigned global order.
Certain aspects are likely to go in India's favour if the Kremlin and Pentagon tread a friendly path, which includes the following:
India's position as a counterbalance against China will become stronger as the US is likely to ease things for Russia. The Russia-China ties have prospered with unprecedented speed while Biden was in power, thanks to his 'pivot to Europe.'. With Trump in power, Beijing-Moscow relations are set to witness a degree of dilution.
As the US and Russia come closer, India will have an open space to undertake defence acquisition with Moscow, without the potential threat of US sanctions hovering overhead. While Biden enjoyed the presidency in the US, trade with Russia appeared a challenge.
Russia has remained sceptical of QUAD, a group of India, the US, Australia, and Japan. With Trump likely to integrate Russia with the Western bloc, Russian apprehension towards the QUAD is also expected to wither away.
If the US decides in favour of lifting sanctions put on Russia, Western powers are likely to follow suit. If Moscow gets rid of sanctions, Indian investments in Russia will be more profitable. For example, Sakhalin projects bring Russia and India together on oil and gas development. India can initiate more energy projects in collaboration with Russia.
The melting ice in the Russia and US relations will potentially give India's defence acquisition a good chance of diversification. The four years of Trump's presidency come at a time when India is more urgently than ever looking to take stopgap measures to plug the gap vis-a-vis China's military prowess. With the Pentagon and Kremlin coming together, India's defence aspirations stand a good chance to benefit.

                                    Chief Election Commissioner appointment | What is selection process and row over new law?",2025-02-17T12:40:12+05:30,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and LoPRahul Gandhiwill meet on Monday regarding the appointment of the new Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) as incumbent Rajiv Kumar is set to retire. This is going to be the first-ever appointment of the CEC, based on the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Term of Office) Act, 2023, which was enacted after getting passed by the Parliament.
However, another tussle is being going on wherein, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a petition challenging the latest law. The apex court will hear the case challenging the validity of the law on February 19, a day after Rajiv Kumar retires.
At the outset, it must be noted that till the 2023 act was passed, India didn't have any mechanism or set procedure for the appointment of CEC and other ECs. Article 324 leaves the appointment at the President's discretion based on the act of Parliament.
Because of the absence of a substantive act, the President used to appoint the officials on the advice of the Executive body, i.e., the PM and Council of Ministers.
In March 2023, the Supreme Court's five-judge Constitutional bench led by Justice KM Joseph, while examining the appointments of the CEC and ECs, noted that appointment shouldn't be done solely on the advice of the Executives and that the appointment process should be independent.
The SC mandated a selection process where the President should appoint CECs and ECs on the advice of the Selection Committee consisting, of the PM, Lok Sabha LoP and CJI. The process was to be followed until Parliament passed a new law.
Subsequently, the Parliament passed Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Term of Office) Act, 2023. It was introduced and passed in Rajya Sabha first and ten by Lok Sabha.
As per the act, the Election Commission has to be appointed by the President on the advice of the Selection Committee. However, the act omitted the CJI role and added a Cabinet Minister to it.
The Prime Minister, Cabinet Minister (nominated by the PM), and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha (or leader of the single largest opposition party) have to decide on names suggested by the Search Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary. However, the Selection Committee is not bound to only those names.
The act was criticised by many for excluding the  Chief Justice of India. However, the government has argued that the Judiciary can't have a role in the appointments of the Executive. In January 2024, two petitions, by MP Mahila Congress general secretary Jaya Thakur and Association for Democratic Reforms were filled in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the act stating that it contravenes the Constitutional Bench judgement.
The act was implemented in March 2024, soon after enactment when two ECs- Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu. It sparked criticism after Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the LoP at that time and a member of the panel claimed that he didn't get adequate time to assess the candidates. This created further contestation.
Later, a Division Bench comprising Justice Sanjiv Khanna Dipankar Datta and A.G. Masih re-listed the case. After successive dates, on February 19, the court will hear the case again and will decide the fate of the act.",Explainer LatestNews,,
"Pope Francis had ‘tranquil’ night in hospital following respiratory crisis, Vatican says",2025-02-23T13:48:49+05:30,"Pope Francis rested during a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, the Vatican said on Sunday.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni’s one-line statement didn’t mention if Francis was up or eating breakfast.
The brief update came after doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition. On Saturday morning, he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection.
The popereceived “high flows” of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update.
The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff “continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday”. Doctors said the prognosis was “reserved”.
Doctors have saidFrancis’ conditionis touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease, and that the main threat facing him is if the infection enters the bloodstream, a serious condition known as sepsis.",,,
On display in Capital: A tribute to Bengal’s artistic traditions,2025-02-23T13:36:10+05:30,"Artist Sharmila Sen’s deep engagement with traditional arts might have begun nearly two decades ago when she was decorating her home, but when she became fully cognizant of the financial challenges faced by the artisans and the imminent risk of many of these crafts fading into obscurity, she felt it was crucial to offer her support.
Over the years, she has forged connections with artisans across West Bengal, helping to preserve and propagate a variety of traditional arts, ranging from mask-making to pattachitra paintings and conch-shell engraving. Collaborating with artisans to incorporate contemporary elements and depictions into their work through workshops at herKolkatahome, she has also been promoting their craftsmanship through exhibitions inDelhiand Kolkata.
In its fifth edition in Delhi now, her showcase titled ‘Art Beyond Tradition’ that is on till March 2 at India Habitat Centre in Delhi highlights traditional masks among other art forms. The entire display of 178 masks, she notes, has been made by artist Shankar Das. The material gamar wood, she elaborates, has been used due to its durability and is first seasoned to strengthen and soften it. “The more elaborate and intricately carved masks can take around a month to create,” she states.
This year, through the display, she is also spotlighting ecological degradation and global warming. “We need to understand the extent of damage our actions are causing,” states Sen, adding how several of the wood panels on sale are dedicated to mother earth, with engravings of flora and fauna. If the panel titled “Maa” depicts a mother’s unconditional love to symbolise how “in nature everything works in harmony”, through “Birds Nest” Sen emphasises how birds rely on mature trees for nesting and loss of trees means loss of critical habitats. The mask “Mother Nature” personifies the natural world, symbolising the earth and nurturing environment.
While wall texts describe the depictions, they also share details of the mask traditions that range from African to Kathakali and Bengal masks. Celebrating feminine energy, meanwhile, are masks depicting deities such as Durga, Ardhanarishwar (half woman and god), as well as mermaids that embody “both allure and danger”.
Last year, when a female postgraduate trainee doctor was found raped and murdered in a Kolkata hospital, Sen paid tribute to her through a mask titled “Tilottama” featuring her portrait alongside her parents, the police and CBI teams. “This was my protest. That work was not for sale or publicity,” states Sen.
Neatly displayed on the table are painted depictions on shells and mother of pearl, from Lord Jagannath to Ganesha, Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha playing a flute and Radha-Krishna. There are two intricate and elaborate painted depictions on Gada Shankh, which Sen notes is rare to find now. There are also engraved conch-shells from artists who belong to Bankura. “The next generation of these craftspeople do not want to carry forward the family legacy as it hardly offers any financial sustenance today,” states Sen.
Like every mask and shell tells a story, it is the same with the pattachitra paintings. Pointing to a work in monochrome, Sen notes how the black colour has been obtained from soot collected from oil lamps, which is then mixed with a specific kind of gum. The Bishnupur pattachitras, she observes, are not as refined and have figures that are side-facing. “Generations ago, families of artists who are now practising this art tradition were soldiers. The paintings are supposed to be slightly rough,” she shares.
As keen art viewers approach her at the exhibition to understand the artistic traditions better, Sen discusses the details with each. “The purpose is to create awareness,” she adds.",,,

"Chhattisgarh woman’s body found stuffed in gunny bag in Pimpri Chinchwad, police launch murder probe",2025-02-23T19:02:40+05:30,"Last seen on the morning of February 19 at a pick-up spot for daily labourers, a 35-year-old woman from Chhattisgarh was found dead in a gunny bag in the Moshi Road area of Pimpri Chinchwad on Friday.
The initial investigation established the identity of the deceased woman as Tannu Devendra Sahu, 35, who hailed from Gariaband district of Chhattisgarh and currently lived in Chakrapani Vasahat in Bhosari.
On Friday evening, the police received a call from the driver of a container who reported a strong foul smell coming from an open space near Matere House Chowk on Jadhavwadi Moshi Road. When patrolling marshals from the Bhosari MIDC police station reached the spot, they discovered the body of the woman which was stuffed in a yellow-coloured gunny bag. The gunny bag had been placed in a bush cover next to the open space, officials said.
A cell phone was also found along with the body which had started decomposing. The police launched the probe with the help of the cell phone and the body was sent for autopsy. A case of murder along with charges of destruction of evidence was registered at Bhosari MIDC police station.
“Initial investigation revealed that the deceased and her husband have been working as daily wage labourers at construction sites. This is her second marriage and the couple have two children.

What’s the ongoing story:Amid complaints of violence and obscenity pertaining to content on digital platforms, especially in the backdrop of the recentRanveer Allahbadia controversy, the Central government is examining the need to create a new legal framework to regulate such platforms.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What does the Constitution of India say about the freedom of expression?
• Read about the Intermediary Guidelines and the Digital Media Ethics Code (IT Rules, 2021).
• What is obscenity?
• What is over-the-top (OTT)?
• How are OTTs regulated in India?
• What laws govern obscenity in online content in India?
• Is YouTube regulated under the Digital Media Ethics Code outlined in the IT Rules?
• How has the Indian judiciary’s view on what constitutes obscenity evolved over the years?
Key Takeaways:
• In its communication to a parliamentary panel, the Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry has said there is a growing concern in the society that the constitutional right of “freedom of expression is being misused to showcase obscene and violent content on digital platforms”.
• It has told the Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology — headed byBJPMP Nishikant Dubey — that while certain provisions exist under the current laws, there is a growing demand for astricter and effective legal frameworkto regulate such harmful content. “This ministry has taken note of these developments and is in the process of examining current statutory provisions and the need for a new legal framework,” it said.
• Less than 10 days ago, the committee had asked the I&B Ministry on February 13 regarding the amendments needed in the existing laws to clamp down controversial content in the wake of the emergence of new technology and media platforms.
• The ministry had just three days ago on February 19 asked social media channels and OTT platforms tofollow the Code of Ethicsprescribed in the IT Rules 2021 and implement “access control for A-rated content” to prevent children from consuming inappropriate material.
• It emphasised that the law requires OTT platforms to “not transmit any content which is prohibited by law (and) undertake age-based classification of content” and cited “the provisions of the Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986, Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, wherein publication of obscene/pornographic content is a punishable offence”.
• Under Part III of the Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code (IT Rules, 2021), online streaming platforms are required to implement a three-level grievance redressal mechanism for violations of the Code of Ethics. This Code also prohibits platforms from transmitting unlawful content, mandates age-based classification, and restricts access to ‘A’-rated content for children.
Do You Know:
• While YouTube is governed under the digital media and ethics code of the IT Rules, the provisions can only apply to content curated by the platform. For content uploaded to an individual’s channel, YouTube will not be treated as a publisher, but rather as a social media intermediary – since such content falls under the purview of user generated content – and can not be held liable for it as long as it adheres to certain government directions, such as blocking content and other due diligence requirements.
• The right to freedom of speech and expression is not absolute. Article 19 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right also provides for reasonable restrictions on various grounds, including that of decency and morality. This means that free speech has to be balanced against the contemporary community standards of morality when it comes to penalising obscene acts or content.
📍Laws Governing Obscenity in Online Content
• Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS):Section 294 of the BNS punishes those who sell, import, export, advertise, or profit from obscene material such as books, paintings, and figures and also includes the “display of any content in electronic form”.  It describes such material as that which “is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest” — material which is overtly and excessively sexual — or which would “tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely…to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it”.
• Section 67 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000:The law on obscenity has evolved with the advent of the Internet and social media. Under Section 67 of the IT Act, anyone who publishes or transmits obscene material in electronic form can be punished.

• Besides, armed forces, civilian police ensuring law enforcement, security is also about “how your thought processes are influenced, how narratives are set, how facts are presented to you, how your mind moulded without you even knowing it,” he said.
Do You Know:
• USAID is the “lead international humanitarian and development arm of the US government”, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).
• The agency provides assistance to other countries primarily by funding non-governmental organisations (NGOs), foreign governments, international organisations, or other US agencies, often for specific programs to alleviate poverty, provide education and healthcare, among other things.
• The agency managed more than $43 billion in funds, and provided assistance to around 130 countries in FY2023. The top 10 recipients of USAID-managed funds in FY2023 were: (in descending order of funding) Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Syria.
• The US has provided development and humanitarian assistance to India since 1951, when President Harry Truman signed the India Emergency Food Assistance Act, according to an archived page on the USAID website. However, its operations in India — as in the rest of the world — have historically come with strings and conditions attached.

What’s the ongoing story:Chakshu Roy writes-“Lok Sabha Member of Parliament Amritpal Singh is apprehensive of losing his parliamentary seat. The Independent MP from Punjab is also in charge of Waris Punjab De, a pro-Khalistan group. He faces charges under the National Security Act and has been in jail since 2023.”
Key Points to Ponder:
• What is Article 101(4) of the Indian Constitution?
• What historical precedents exist for Members of Parliament (MPs) losing their seats due to prolonged absence from Parliament?
• How does Parliament document the attendance of its members?
• What is the process for MPs to apply for leave from the Lok Sabha andRajya Sabha, and how are these requests processed?
• How did the Government of India Act, 1935, influence the inclusion of the 60-day absence provision in the Indian Constitution?
• Why does an MP’s seat not automatically become vacant after 60 days of absence?  What procedure must the House follow to declare it vacant?
Key Takeaways:
• “Recently, Amritpal approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court, stating that he would lose his seat under Article 101(4) of the Constitution if he could not attend theBudgetSession.”
• “The Article specifies that if an MP is absent from Parliament (without permission) for 60 days, their seat can be declared vacant. Amritpal has attended Parliament only once — to take oath — since the beginning of the 18th Lok Sabha in 2024. The court has now asked the government whether the Lok Sabha has constituted a committee that sanctions the leave application of MPs.”
• “The 60-day absence provision was part of the Government of India Act, 1935. It then found its way into the Constitution. In 1950, the provisional Parliament declared three seats as vacant under this provision. Then, in 1956, the first Lok Sabha took action against an Odisha MP, who had stayed away from the House due to domestic troubles and ill health. The provision came to national attention in 1976. This time, a first-time Rajya Sabha MP was on the brink of losing his seat under Article 101(4). His name, Subramanian Swamy.
• “Let us see how Parliament documents the presence of our public representatives. The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha maintain a record of an MP’s participation in House proceedings. So, if a member speaks in the House or casts a vote, it shows they were present. MPs can also mark their presence by signing an attendance register maintained by both Houses of Parliament. The Secretariat uses these registers to calculate the allowances to MPs.”
• “If MPs cannot attend Parliament, they can request leave from the two Houses. In the Lok Sabha, the leave applications go to a committee, while the Rajya Sabha decides these requests on the House floor.”
• “Leave requests are rarely denied. And being in jail while proceedings are ongoing is grounds for asking for leave. For example, during the last Lok Sabha (2019-24), Atul Rai, theBahujan Samaj Party(BSP) MP from Uttar Pradesh, was in prison for most of his five-year term and the committee approved his leave.”
Do You Know:
• Even if an MP is absent for more than 60 days, the House has to “declare” the seat vacant, meaning the matter has to be put to vote.

What’s the ongoing story:After conducting a $5 billion dollar-rupee swap less than a month ago, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday (February 21) decided to inject rupee liquidity for longer duration through another $10 billion dollar-rupee buy-sell swap arrangement.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What is a dollar-rupee swap?
• How does a swap work?
• What is open market operation (OMO)?
• What is the liquidity of the banking system?
• What is the liquidity deficit of banks in India?
• How liquidity is managed by RBI?
• What measures has the RBI taken to ensure liquidity in the economy?
• How does the swap mechanism help stabilize the value of the Indian rupee during periods of foreign fund outflows?
• How does the RBI’s intervention in the forex market impact the liquidity of the rupee in the banking system?
Key Takeaways:
• The central bank’s initiative is designed to provide a durable solution to the system’s liquidity requirements, while also stabilising the value of the rupee and bolstering the nation’s foreign exchange kitty.
• The swap mechanism can help stabilize the currency by providing immediate liquidity support, thereby mitigating the pressure on the rupee during periods of foreign fund outflows. This temporary relief can bolster market confidence and prevent excessive volatility in the exchange rate.
• It will also beef up the dollar reserves of the RBI at a time when it’s intervening in the forex market to prevent a slide in the rupee. The central bank will be conducting the $10 billion swap auction for a tenor of 3 years next week.
• The Indian banking system encountered its worst liquidity crunch in more than a decade in January 2025. The liquidity deficit peaked at Rs 3.15 lakh crore on January 23, its lowest level in nearly 15 years.
• The RBI has been selling dollars to stabilise the rupee, thereby sucking out an equivalent amount in rupee from the system.
• The swap is in the nature of a simple buy-sell foreign exchange swap from the Reserve Bank side. A bank will sell US dollars to the Reserve Bank and simultaneously agrees to buy the same amount of US dollars at the end of the swap period.
• The RBI had infused over Rs 3.6 lakh crore of durable liquidity into the banking system in the last five weeks through debt purchases, forex swaps and longer-duration repos.
Do You Know:
• The RBI uses Open market operations (OMOs) in order to adjust the rupee liquidity conditions in the market on a durable basis. When the Reserve Bank feels that there is excess liquidity in the market, it resorts to the sale of government securities, thereby sucking out the rupee liquidity. Similarly, when the liquidity conditions are tight, the central bank buys securities from the market, thereby releasing liquidity into the market. It’s used as a tool to rein ininflationand money supply in the system.

What’s the ongoing story:Union Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamanon Saturday said India was not just leading in the adoption of artificial intelligence but also shaping how Al is governed.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
• What are the areas of AI application?
• Is there any legal framework for AI regulation globally and nationally?
• What are the benefits of AI?
• What are the ethical issues related to AI?
• What are the initiatives taken by India to integrate AI?
• What are the challenges related to AI?
What are the important bilateral cooperation signed by India to promote AI?
• What are the key highlights of Paris AI Summit?
• Read about the India artificial intelligence (AI) Mission?
Key Takeaways:
• Speaking at the sixth convocation of the Indian Institute of Information Technology- Kottayam (IIIT-Kottayam), Sitharaman said that India was not just ready for Al, but the demand for Al-driven solutions was also high in the country.
• She said this was evident from the fact that the country recorded 3 billion Al-related app downloads in 2024, while the US and China had only 1.5 billion and 1.3 billion downloads, respectively.
• The Finance Minister also said that India being made the co-chair at the recent Al Action Summit in Paris was a recognition of the country’s global position in the sector.
Do You Know:
• Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines, especially computers, to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include things like understanding language, recognising patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.
• Essentially, AI enables machines to think and learn from experience, just like humans do, but often at a much faster pace with access to vast amounts of data.
• AI can be classified into two types: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) also known as weak AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) also referred to as strong AI.
• ANI is designed for specific tasks and excels within a narrow domain. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri, recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix, and image recognition software. ANI systems are highly specialised and cannot transfer their expertise to unrelated tasks.
• In contrast, AGI aims to replicate human cognitive abilities, enabling it to perform any intellectual task a human can do. AGI would possess general reasoning skills, understand context, and adapt to new situations across various domains. It would be capable of autonomous learning and problem-solving without requiring task-specific programming.
• Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are subsets of AI but differ in complexity and capabilities. ML involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions and often requires manual feature extraction.
• DL, a subset of ML, uses neural networks with many layers (hence “deep”) to automatically learn features from large datasets. While ML works well with smaller datasets, DL requires vast amounts of data and computational power.

• What are the digital services taxes in India?
• How do digital service taxes impact international trade relations?
• What are tariffs and how do tariffs work?

• The digital service taxes aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants including Alphabet’sGoogle(GOOGL.O),Meta’sFacebook(META.O),Apple(AAPL.O)  and Amazon (AMZN.O), have been a longstanding trade irritant for multiple U.S. administrations.
• Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, India, Austria and Canada have levied the taxes on sales revenue by these and other digital services providers within their borders.
• During Trump’s first term, USTR launched Section 301 unfair trade practices against several of these countries, finding they discriminated against U.S. companies, paving the way for retaliatory tariffs on certain imports.
From “Reciprocal tariffs ‘soon for India, China: US President”
• US President Donald Trump has said that his administration will “soon” impose reciprocal tariffs on countries such as India and China, reiterating what he had said during Prime MinisterNarendra Modi’s recent visit to the US capital.
Do You Know:
• Tariffs are taxes or duties imposed by a government on imported goods and services. Their objective is to make foreign products more expensive compared to domestically produced goods, thereby encouraging consumers to prefer local products. Tariffs also act as a protective measure for domestic industries against foreign competition. Additionally, they serve as a source of revenue for the government.

Ditch the plastic! New study links takeout containers to increased heart failure risk,"Updated23 Feb 2025, 07:17 PM IST","Eating from Plastic Containers? It could increase your risk of heart failure! A recent study has revealed alarming health implications associated with eating from plastic takeout containers, linking it to an increased risk of congestive heart failure. Conducted by Chinese researchers, the study involved over 3,000 participants and examined the effects of plastic exposure on heart health. Even short-term exposure to particles leaching into food or liquid from plastic containers “can induce changes in cardiac muscle tissue” that indicates cardiovascular disease, said the study published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety. The findings were observed over three months, during which rats were fed water that had been exposed to boiling water in plastic containers at different intervals – 1 minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes. “The results indicated that ingestion of these leachates altered the intestinal microenvironment, affected gut microbiota composition, and modified gut microbiota metabolites, particularly those linked to inflammation and oxidative stress,” the study said. “Additionally, this exposure resulted in damage to the heart muscle tissue of the rats, alongside increased markers of myocardial injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress,” it added. “It leads to changes in myocardial tissue, gut microbiota, and metabolites, all closely tied to CVD,” the authors of the study said. They also cited a previous study, which said: “Plastics contain endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) like bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs) and plasticizers, which are linked to higher CVD risk.” How to Reduce Heart Failure Risk?To mitigate heart failure risks, experts recommend avoiding plastic containers, especially for hot food. Instead, opting for glass, wood, or stainless steel alternatives can significantly reduce exposure to harmful chemicals124. Plastic in Brain?In a separate study published in the journal Nature Medicine earlier this month, researchers from the University of New Mexico and other institutions examined organs collected from autopsies of 91 people who died over the last quarter century.  The scientists tested small samples from different organs, including the brain, liver and kidneys, to measure the amount of plastic present. The results concluded that plastic is lodged primarily in our brains.",,,
"Mahakumbh 2025: Ishant Sharma takes sacred dip ahead of IPL, says ‘felt divine energy’","Published23 Feb 2025, 07:09 PM IST","Mahakumbh 2025: Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma recently took a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam in Mahakumbh, Prayagraj.

"Germany Elections: Scholz, Merz, Habeck, Weidel vie for leadership in high-stakes battle after coalition collapse","Updated23 Feb 2025, 07:21 PM IST","Germany Elections: Voters in Germany are casting their ballots in a highly anticipated national election on Sunday (February 23). The election follows the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition last year, forcing an early vote. Four key candidates are in the running: Scholz, opposition leader Friedrich Merz, Vice Chancellor and Greens candidate Robert Habeck, and far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel. Coalition Government likelyGermany’s electoral system rarely delivers an absolute majority to a single party, and opinion polls suggest a coalition government will once again be required. Conservative leader Friedrich Merz, the front-runner, has stated he aims to form a government by mid-April if he secures victory. Until a new government is formed, Scholz’s outgoing administration will continue in a caretaker capacity. Newly naturalised Germans eligible to voteOver 500,000 newly naturalized German citizens, many originally from Syria, are eligible to vote in this election. The significance is particularly strong for these voters, as many fled war and political instability in their home country. Since the last national election in 2021, the number of naturalised citizens has increased sharply, with many now participating in Germany’s democratic process. Merz and AfD’s role in the electionMerz, the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is facing criticism for what some perceive as a softening stance towards the far-right AfD. He insists he has not broken Germany’s long-standing “firewall” against far-right collaboration. Meanwhile, AfD, known for its anti-immigration stance, is poised to make historic gains, leveraging discontent over migration policies, energy transitions, and pandemic restrictions. Public protests and oppositionThousands have taken to the streets across Germany in recent weeks, protesting against AfD and Friedrich Merz’s proposals on migration, which received AfD’s backing in parliament. Former Chancellor Angela Merkel has also voiced concerns over potential collaboration with the far right. Impact of Trump Administration on German politicsGermany’s next government will play a crucial role in shaping Europe’s response to US President Donald Trump’s administration. Chancellor Scholz previously described a second Trump presidency as a “challenge.” Meanwhile, AfD’s Alice Weidel has echoed Trump’s rhetoric, vowing to “make Germany great again.” Polling and election processAt least 59.2 million German citizens are eligible to vote, including 2.3 million first-time voters. Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. and will close at 6 p.m. local time. Exit polls will be released immediately after voting ends, with official results expected early Monday. Key candidates cast their votesFriedrich Merz and Chancellor Olaf Scholz both cast their votes early on Sunday, along with Greens candidate Robert Habeck and AfD leader Alice Weidel. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also voted in Berlin, reinforcing the election’s importance for Germany’s political future. Germany’s role in Europe and NATOAs the European Union’s most populous nation and a key NATO member, Germany’s election results will have a significant impact on Europe’s approach to global challenges, including security, trade, and international diplomacy. The next German government will need to navigate relations with both the Trump administration and ongoing conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war.",,,

"Alice Weidel, first openly gay leader of far-right AfD, steals limelight as Germany votes to choose its Chancellor","Published23 Feb 2025, 06:53 PM IST","As voters in Germany go out on Sunday to vote for their new leader in a pivotal election, all eyes will be frozen on the openly gay leader of the divisive far-right party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Alice Weidel. An unusual choice to many to lead AfD’s electoral ambitions, Alice Weidel is the first ever candidate of the anti-immigration party for the post of the Chancellor. She lives with her partner in Switzerland, while being an active member of the German party. AfD, which bats against asylum seekers, Islam and multiculturalism, is unlikely to win a government amid other parties not eager to cooperate due to a longstanding policy named firewall. However, the party, led by Weidel, is likely to emerge as the second-largest in the parliament. Here is what you need to know about Alice Weidel. A business administration geniusAlice Weidel studied economics and business administration at the University of Bayreuth, graduating as one of the best students of the 2004 batch. Following her graduation, she went on to work as an analyst with Goldman Sachs Asset Management from July 2005 to June 2006. Thereafter, for six years, she worked at the Bank of China, living in the country. Weidel also has a doctorate in international development, receiving it magna cum laude. Joining AfDAlice Weidel joined the Alternative for Germany in 2013, becoming the first lesbian leader to lead the party. Weidel’s story with the party started with their mutual opposition for the euro. In April 2017, she became the co-lead of the party. Support from Elon Musk and other RepublicansThe 46-year-old, who says Margaret Thatcher is her political idol, has found herself basking in support of Republicans of the United States, including President Donald Trump’s aide and billionaire Elon Musk. In a live-streamed chat with Alice Weidel in January, Elon Musk heaped praise on AfD, touting her as the “leading candidate to run Germany”. The duo railed against ""woke"" policies before chatting about Musk's plans to settle Mars and Germany's dark history, with Weidel insisting Hitler was a ""communist"". She also met US Vice President JD Vance at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which had banned AfD from taking part. Criticising the move, Vance had said “…when political leaders represent an important constituency, it is incumbent upon us to at least participate in dialogue with them.” Queer or not?Alice Weidel is in a civil partnership, which is similar to a marriage, with her partner Sarah Bossard, a Sri Lankan-origin filmmaker. The couple have two children together and live in Switzerland. “I am not queer but I am married to a woman I have known for 20 years,” she said in a past interview. Weidel has avoided any curiosity regarding her relationship due to her LGBT+ status, which clashes with the AfD’s ideology of promoting a traditional nuclear family and dismissing “alternative lifestyles”. Weidel has sought to downplay this issue, calling families as units “where there are children”.",,,
IND vs PAK: Rohit Sharma suffers injury scare against Pakistan in Champions Trophy; India captain struggles in field,"Updated23 Feb 2025, 07:12 PM IST","Rohit Sharma was seen struggling while fielding as the Indian captain is believed to have pulled his hamstring against Pakistan during their Group A clash in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Sunday. The incident first came to light when Rohit Sharma suddenly left the field leaving the captaincy duties to Shubman Gill. He was absent from the field for nearly 10 overs before returning. It was at that time when the Indian captain was caught struggling to move freely on the field, and frequently held his leg. On commentary, former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik spotted Rohit Sharma's struggles in his hamstring while celebrating Babar Azam’s wicket. His on-field struggles once again came to fore when the 37-year-old was seen running slowly in the 39th over after Khushdil Shah reverse-swept Ravindra Jadeja. Spotted at short square leg, Rohit Sharma chased the ball but had to give up due to his hamstring discomfort. The commentators also pointed out that Rohit Sharma was avoiding fielding at high-intensity positions. However, Rohit Sharma returned to bat without any discomfort as he opened the Indian innings with Shubman Gill. India restrict Pakistan for 241Despite his discomfort, Rohit Sharma was spot on with his bowling changes as India bowled out Pakistan for 241 in 49.4 overs. Saud Shakeel top-scored for Pakistan with a 62 off 76 balls, while skipper Mohammad Rizwan made a laborious 46 from 77 deliveries. The two batters added 104 runs for the third wicket. Khushdil Shah chipped in with a 39-ball 38 to lift Pakistan after they slipped to 165 for five at the start of the 37th over. Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav (3/40) picked up three wickets after all-rounder Hardik Pandya (2/31) dismissed Babar Azam (23) and Shakeel.

Hardik Pandya rocks rare Rafael Nadal watch during Ind-Pak match. THIS Ambani is the ONLY other Indian who owns it,"Published23 Feb 2025, 06:39 PM IST","India vs Pakistan: India is playing against Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, February 23. The 31-year-old all-rounder Hardik Pandya was spotted wearing one of the most sought-after and exclusive watches on earth, the Richard Mille Rafael Nadal edition, the RM27-02 CA FQ Tourbillon with a skeleton dial at the match on Sunday.  India-Pakistan match scoreAfter winning the toss, Pakistan decided to take up batting first and has scored 241 runs in the match against India on Sunday at Dubai International Stadium. India needs 242 runs to win the match against Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.  The Rafael Nadal watchThe Richard Mille RM 027, popularly known as the Rafael Nadal watch in the luxury watches community, is one of the most lightweight watches ever produced. The RM27-02 watch weighs a little under 20 grams, including the strap. It was created in collaboration with Tennis titan Rafael Nadal and is part of the entire RM27 lineup, which was tailor-made for the sports icon. “It is from the key concept of lightness that we developed the RM 027 Tourbillon in close collaboration with Rafael Nadal, who tested the RM 027 in real-world conditions and wore it during tennis matches,” according to the Richard Mille website.  The watch is currently worth somewhere between  ₹12 to 15 crore on the grey market as secondary pricing, and only a limited amount of pieces were made for the series. According to multiple media reports, Rafael Nadal was hesitant to wear any watch on his arm while playing tennis, giving Richard Mille the challenge to create such a lightweight watch. According to Nico Leonard, who owns Pride and Pinion company, this watch in the secondary market, a relatively new piece of an RM27-02, may even fetch nearly $2 million. Anant Ambani, son of business tycoon Mukesh Ambani of the Reliance Group, owns an RM27-02 like Hardik Pandya. Anant Ambani was spotted wearing this watch at an IPL final when Mumbai Indians won the series. ",,,
"Municipal Body To Make 12,000 Contractual Workers Permanent: Atishi","Feb 23, 2025 19:17 pm IST","The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) will regularise 12,000 contractual workers in its House meeting on Tuesday, AAP leader Atishi said. During a press conference alongside MCD Mayor Mahesh Khinchi, Deputy Mayor Ravinder Bharadwaj, and Leader of the House Mukesh Goel, former Delhi chief minister Atishi announced the decision, stating the AAP is committed to regularising temporary workers in the party-led MCD. ""In the last two years, we have made 4,500 (contractual) workers permanent. Now, in the MCD House meeting on February 25, we are set to regularise 12,000 more employees across all departments, including sanitation workers, junior engineers, senior engineers, gardeners, and other contractual staff,"" she said. Atishi also drew a parallel with AAP's governance in Punjab, where temporary teachers are being made permanent, reinforcing the party's commitment to workers' rights. ""AAP delivers on its promises. This decision will be the biggest of its kind in the city's history,"" she added. Atishi also took a dig at the BJP, claiming that the saffron party often makes excuses to avoid fulfilling its commitments.   ""I knew the BJP would try to escape from its promises. That's why, before the new chief minister was appointed, we ensured that the Delhi government presented its financial status clearly,"" she said. She highlighted Delhi's economic growth under the AAP, stating that when the party first formed the government in 2015, the city's budget stood at Rs 30,000 crore. ""Despite receiving no financial support from the central government, we strengthened Delhi's economy. Today, the budget for 2024-25 has reached Rs 77,000 crore, marking a 2.5-time increase in the last decade,"" she claimed.

Preliminary Probe Not Mandatory In All Cases Under Prevention Of Corruption Act: Top Court,"Feb 23, 2025 18:40 pm IST","The Supreme Court has said conducting a preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case lodged under the Prevention of Corruption Act and it is not a vested right of the accused. The court has said while a preliminary inquiry is desirable in certain categories of cases, including those lodged under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, it is not a mandatory pre-requisite for the registration of a criminal case. A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Sandeep Mehta has said the purpose of a preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity of the information received, but merely to ascertain whether the said information revealed the commission of a cognisable offence. ""The preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case under the PC Act,"" the bench said in its verdict delivered on February 17. ""If a superior officer is in seisin of a source information report, which is both detailed and well-reasoned and such that any reasonable person would be of the view that it prima facie discloses the commission of a cognisable offence, the preliminary inquiry may be avoided,"" it said. The top court delivered its verdict on an appeal filed by the Karnataka government, challenging a March 2024 judgment of the state high court.   The high court had quashed an FIR lodged by the Karnataka Lokayukta police station against a public servant for alleged offences under the PC Act. The public servant was accused of acquiring assets that were disproportionate to his known sources of income. The top court dealt with the issue of whether a preliminary inquiry was mandatory before directing registration of an FIR under the PC Act in the facts of the case or whether the source information report could be treated as a substitute for the preliminary inquiry. Referring to previous top court judgments, the bench said, ""Applying these principles to the case at hand, it is perspicuous that conducting a preliminary inquiry is not sine qua non for registering a case against a public servant who is accused of corruption."" ""While a preliminary inquiry is desirable in certain categories of cases, including those under the PC Act, it is neither a vested right of the accused nor a mandatory pre-requisite for the registration of a criminal case,"" it said. The court said the determination of whether a preliminary inquiry was necessary or not would vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case. It said the high court had erred in concluding that the FIR was liable to be quashed on account of the omission to conduct a preliminary inquiry in the case. The bench also referred to section 17 of the PC Act that pertains to persons authorised to investigate. It said in this case, the superintendent of police, after forming an opinion that the source information report of November 2023 prima facie disclosed the necessary ingredients of offences punishable under the Act, had directed the deputy superintendent of police to register an FIR against the accused and authorised him to investigate the case. ""We are of the opinion that the high court gravely erred while imposing unwarranted fetters on the investigation agency in corruption cases by carving out a framework of administrative hurdles, which may have the potential of incapacitating law-enforcement agencies,"" it said. The court said by mandating elaborate pre-investigation procedures and creating unwarranted procedural check dams, the high court's approach had the potential to render the effectiveness of law enforcement nugatory. The top court said the legislative intent behind the Act was to provide a robust mechanism for investigating corruption-related offences and avoid the creation of meandering procedural hurdles that shield corrupt officials. ""While interpreting such procedural laws, it must be borne in mind that the interpretation should facilitate and not frustrate the investigation of potential criminal activities, particularly in cases involving serious allegations of corruption,"" it said. It said a fair probe cannot be interpreted to cater to the accused only, rather it must be such that the entire investigation process has the backing of the law and the due procedure established therein. The bench noted that the superintendent of police was entrusted with the administrative authority to direct his subordinates to register an FIR upon receiving a factual report, which prima facie disclosed the commission of offences punishable under the PC Act. ""The high court erred in coming to the conclusion that the order dated December 4, 2023, passed by the superintendent of police, was directly passed under section 17 of the PC Act, thereby violating the mandatory provisions of the PC Act,"" it said. The bench set aside the high court's verdict and restored the FIR lodged against the accused.

In a letter to party cadres ahead of late Chief Minister J Jayaylalithaa's 77th birth anniversary on Monday, he asked if ""the wolf and sheep can co-exist?"" ""Can the wolf and sheep co-exist? Can weeds and crops be part of a harvest? Can the loyalist and traitor stand shoulder-to-shoulder? I hear your assertive no,"" he said. The remarks are seen as a veiled response to OPS. Days ago, former Chief Minister Panneerselvam had said he was willing to return to the AIADMK but insisted that the all-powerful general secretary post in the party should be elected by cadres. ""I, TTV Dinakaran and Sasikala (who were also expelled from the AIADMK) are ready to unite with the AIADMK without any conditions. We can sort out the issues through talks,"" Panneerselvam, who now heads the ADMK Workers' Rights' Retrieval Committee, had said. Mr Palaniswami, attacking the MK Stalin-led Tamil Nadu government over a number of issues including women's safety, said people were unhappy with the ruling dispensation and yearned for the AIADMK to come back to power, after the Assembly polls due next year.   The former CM also hailed Jayalalithaa for delivering effective governance despite a number of challenges, including the financial one which he said was created by the then Congress-led UPA government at the Centre in which the DMK was an integral part. Jayalalithaa led the AIADMK to power in 2011 with a massive majority, and again in 2016, and led the government till her death in December that year. The AIADMK was in power for 10 years between 2011-2021, a rare feat in Tamil Nadu's political history.

"100 Gold Pieces, SUV Seized From Anna University Sexual Assault Accused","Feb 23, 2025 17:00 pm IST","The Greater Chennai Police have recovered 100 sovereigns of gold and a luxury car from Gnanasekharan, a biryani vendor, who was arrested in connection with the sexual assault of an engineering student at Anna University on December 23, 2024. Investigations revealed that Gnanasekharan was also involved in multiple thefts. According to police sources, he confessed to robbing seven houses in the Pallikaranai area in Chennai. The stolen money was allegedly used to buy a luxury car, while the stolen jewellery was sold to fund his biryani business and finance a lavish lifestyle. Following the confession, police traced and seized 100 sovereigns of gold from two dealers in Chennai. Gnanasekharan is currently in police custody for further interrogation after the Alandur court granted a three-day remand in connection with the theft cases. He was initially arrested on December 25, 2024, for the sexual assault case at Anna University, where he allegedly attacked a female student and assaulted her in a secluded area of the campus.   Following his arrest, he was detained under the Goondas Act based on the recommendation of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) handling the case. The case has sparked a political controversy, with Tamil Nadu BJP president K. Annamalai staging a protest outside his residence in Coimbatore. He flogged himself six times to symbolise what he described as the deteriorating law and order situation. Mr Annamalai also announced a 48-day fast and a pilgrimage to the six holy abodes of Lord Murugan as part of his protest. He criticised the Tamil Nadu Police for allegedly leaking the FIR in the case, which unintentionally exposed the identity of the 19-year-old victim. He further accused the police of not including Gnanasekharan in the state's ""rowdy list"" despite his involvement in multiple criminal cases. Mr Annamalai claimed this was due to the accused's ""links"" with the ruling DMK. He presented evidence suggesting that Gnanasekharan was a DMK functionary and alleged that the ruling party was attempting to divert attention from the state's law and order issues by pushing a narrative of a North-South divide.

USAID Funded 7 Projects In India Worth $750 Million In FY24: Finance Ministry Report,"Feb 23, 2025 17:06 pm IST","The latest annual report of the Finance Ministry said USAID funded seven projects worth $750 million in 2023-24. ""Currently, seven projects worth a total budget of $750 million (approximately) are being implemented by the USAID in partnership with the government of India,"" the Finance Ministry annual report for 2023-24 said. For the financial year 2023-24, an obligation of a total of $97 million (about Rs 825 crore) has been made by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under the seven projects, it said. The Department of Economic Affairs under the Finance Ministry which is the nodal department for bilateral funding arrangements has also shared the details of projects funded in 2023-24 in the report. During the year, no funding was made for enhancing voter turnout, but to projects related to agriculture and food security programmes; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); renewable energy; disaster management and health.   It said funds were committed for sustainable forests and climate adaptation programme, and energy efficiency technology commercialization and innovation project. The US' bilateral development assistance to India started in 1951 and it is mainly administered through USAID. Since its commencement, USAID has provided economic assistance of over $17 billion to India in various sectors for over 555 projects. Political controversy erupted earlier this month after the Elon Musk-led DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) said it cancelled a $21 million grant to India to boost ""voter turnout"". US President Donald Trump repeatedly said USAID under the previous administration led by Joe Biden allocated $21 million in funding to India for 'voter turnout'.

""BJP is a procession of liars and illiterates. The news about $21 million, on which the BJP and their bootlickers were jumping on, turned out to be fake.

"Red Bull’s title hopes dented by the new FIA directives, says Christian Horner","Modified Feb 23, 2025 13:17 GMT","Red Bull team principal Christian Horner is unimpressed with the FIA's new directives related to flexi wings. The FIA is reportedly planning to introduce stricter restrictions on flexi-wing tests, which Horner believes will cause a dent in his team's championship hopes.
The 2024 F1 season saw many controversies erupt, including the debate around flexi wings. The Bulls suspected that McLaren and many other teams were violating the maximum flexibility limit allowed by the FIA.
However, while the FIA refused to intervene then, Autoracer reported that the governing body is likely to tighten flexi wing testing parameters from the 2025 Spanish Grand Prix, which is the ninth race of the season.
According to reports, the maximum flexibility allowed between two flaps of the front and rear wings will be reduced.
However, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner isn't impressed with the reported timing of the introduction of the alleged new rules.
Talking to Autoracer, Horner said:
The report from Autoracer also mentions that the energy drink-based outfit expressed strong revolt against the new rules.
Meanwhile, McLaren is reportedly onboard with the new flexi wing rules and does not see it impacting their performance in the upcoming season.
McLaren are the defending constructors champions after they beat Ferrari and Red Bull in the 2024 season. Moreover, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri will be equal contenders for the drivers championship.
Red Bull Racing lost the 2024 constructors championship to McLaren and Ferrari, finishing P3 in the standings. However, team principal Christian Horner does not mind being an underdog for the upcoming season.
Talking to Autoracer, Horner threw weight on rivals McLaren and said:
McLaren has promised to come out even stronger in the 2025 F1 season. Lando Norris is also committed to accomplishing his unfinished business, which is winning the constructors championship.
However, Red Bull has a trump card in Max Verstappen. As a four-time world champion, he will likely have an edge over his rivals.

Virat Kohli takes diving catch to create massive record in IND vs PAK Champions Trophy 2025 clash [Watch],"Modified Feb 23, 2025 18:54 IST","Team India star Virat Kohli took a diving catch to see the back of Naseem Shah in the Champions Trophy 2025 clash against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium. The veteran batter now also holds the record for most catches by an Indian in ODIs, going past Mohammad Azharuddin's tally of 156 catches.
The dismissal occurred in the 47th over of the innings as Kuldeep Yadav came in for his second-last. Naseem, who was playing proactively, only chipped the ball in the air. The Delhi-born cricketer attacked the ball and put in a full-throttle dive to catch the ball cleanly.
It also proved to be the left-arm wrist-spinner's third wicket, having dismissed Salman Ali Agha and Shaheen Shah Afridi in consecutive deliveries previously.
Watch the clip here:
The Men in Blue, who had lost an important toss, dismissed Pakistan inside 50 overs for 241. Only Saud Shakeel managed to reach a half-century and his 104-run partnership with captain Mohammad Rizwan was decisive after the defending champions were reduced to 47/2 after a decent start.
Khushdil Shah, who was also dismissed by a catch from Kohli for an invaluable 38, proved to be the star cricketer's 158th catch.
Former Indian skipper Virat Kohli is only 15 runs away from 14,000 ODI runs and will become the fastest to get to the milestone when he does. With that, he will join Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara in the elusive list. He was dismissed only for 22 runs against Bangladesh.
Should India win the contest against Pakistan, they will likely be assured of a semi-final spot. However, the game looms as a must-win for Rizwan and company as they lost their opening match by 60 runs to New Zealand.
The likes of Haris Rauf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and Naseem Shah must come good if the reigning Champions Trophy champions are to defend 241 on a tricky surface.

While Virat Kohli overtook Mohammad Azharuddin to become the Indian fielder with most catches in ODIs, he is also third in the overall list now with 157 catches.

Kuldeep Yadav bags 2 wickets in 2 balls to leave Pakistan in disarray in IND vs PAK 2025 Champions Trophy clash [Watch],"Modified Feb 23, 2025 18:23 IST","Kuldeep Yadav struck twice to bring India in pole position against Pakistan in the 2025 Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, February 23. The left-arm wrist-spinner took the prized scalp of Salman Agha before dismissing Shaheen Afridi off the next delivery.
The dismissals came in the 43rd over of Pakistan’s innings. Kuldeep bowled a fuller length ball and Agha looked to place it towards square leg. However, the right-handed batter top-edged it towards Ravindra Jadeja, who circled around it before completing the catch in between point and covers. Agha departed for 19 runs off 24 balls.
Kuldeep followed up the wicket delivery with a length ball on the fourth stump, which shaped inwards on Afridi. The left-hander failed to defend it with the straight bat and the spinner trapped the southpaw in front of the stumps. With a golden duck, Afridi left Pakistan reeling at 200/7 in the high-voltage clash.
Watch the video below:
Pakistan lost the plot against India in the Champions Trophy 2025 clash. This came after skipper Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel shared a 104-run stand to recover the hosts from 47/2. Shakeel failed to consolidate after 62 runs off 76 balls, while Rizwan (46 off 77 deliveries) threw away his wicket while taking a swipe against Axar Patel.
At the time of writing, the Men in Green were 222/8, with Haris Rauf and Khusdil Shah at the crease. Kuldeep Yadav has been the pick of the bowlers, bagging three wickets. Meanwhile, Hardik Pandya has scalped two wickets.

                                    Bihar: Jewellery worth Rs 30 lakh stolen in 10 seconds; CCTV footage shocks shopkeeper | VIDEO",2025-01-31T19:43:17+05:30,"In a shocking incident in Bihar’s Begusarai district, a major theft was carried out in mere 10 seconds of gold jewellery worth over Rs 30 lakhs. The incident took place in Veerpur market under the Veerpur police station area.
The alleged miscreant reportedly ran away with a bag full of gold jewellery from a jewellery shop. However, the entire theft was captured in the CCTV camera installed near the shop. The footage clearly shows the theft of the jewellery.
It can be seen in the CCTV footage that the shopkeeper came to the shop at around 10:45 am and after opening one shutter, he went to open the other shutter. In the meantime, a miscreant came and stole a bag full of jewellery and ran away.
It is being said that Kiran Sah, a resident of Veerpur, is the owner of the jewellery shop near Mazar Chowk in Veerpur market.
He opened one shutter and kept the bag full of jewellery on the counter. After this, he went to open the second shutter, when the theft took place. When he returned after opening the shutter and did not find the bag, he raised an alarm.
However, the accused took advantage of the situation and fled. Shah lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The police of Veerpur police station are investigating the matter. Action is being taken to identify and arrest the youth seen on the CCTV.
The shopkeeper Kiran Sah said that the bag contained 400 grams of gold jewellery and the key to the shop’s locker. SHO Sanjeev Kumar said that the police have started investigating the case.
“The CCTV camera has been checked. The shopkeeper has not given a written application yet. After receiving the application, we will clearly tell the value of the goods,” Kumar said.
The police suspect that the amount of gold in the bag was not as much as the shopkeeper is saying and neither has the shopkeeper shown any documents related to the claim of 400 grams of gold jewellery being present in the bag.

Yadav shared a purported video clip of the function on X in which Kumar stood flanked on either side by his deputy Vijay Kumar Sinha and Assembly Speaker Nand Kishor Yadav.

Kumar could be purportedly seen, at one point of time, clapping his hands, much to the shock of those present on the sombre occasion. The longest serving CM of the state was, however, back to senses soon and he stood ramrod straight at the ceremony.
""Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is a worshipper of Godse. He claps to celebrate the assassination of Gandhi ji, the father of the nation, by Godse. Shri Nitish Kumar ji worships the Sangh and Godse from the depths of his heart,"" alleged the RJD leader.
Yadav thereafter launched into a diatribe about the ""mental state"" of the septuagenarian, saying that ""does this incident not show that Nitish Kumar's state of mind is not such that he can run Bihar?""
Recalling a faux pas by Kumar at a Dussehra function last year, Yadav said ""he had dropped the bow and arrow thinking it was a snake. Such has been his state of mind"".

This comes after former Bihar MLA Anant Singh escaped unhurt following an exchange of fire between two groups on January 22. As per the information, Sonu is the gangster of the 'Sonu-Monu gang', while Roshan is said to be a supporter of Anant Singh.
The firing incident had taken place in Mokama's Naurang Jalalpur village. Locals claim that the firing occurred at the house of Mukesh Singh. The dispute arose when Mukesh Singh’s house lock was opened, leading to heavy gunfire between Anant Singh's supporters and gangsters Sonu and Monu. Three FIRs have been lodged against both groups at Panchmahla police station.
Earlier on Thursday, a special police team arrived at the residence of Sonu and Monu in Jamalpur village, Mokama, to inspect their house and further investigate the firing incident involving former MLA Anant Kumar Singh and his supporters. The firing reportedly occurred between two gangs in the Mokama area under the Pachmala Police Station limits on Wednesday evening. Former MLA Anant Singh alleged that Sonu and Monu were involved in the incident, labelling them as ""kidnappers and thieves.""
Commenting on the incident, Singh told reporters that a group of poor people from Nauranga village met him and alleged that they were thrown out of their houses by some influential people, who also locked their residences. ""I went to the village in the evening and asked my supporters to open the locks. I also asked my people to call those who had forcibly locked the houses of poor people. When my men reached the home of Sonu-Monu (villagers), they were attacked. Supporters of Sonu-Monu started firing….and my men also retaliated,"" Singh said.
According to the initial police investigation, the clash reportedly stemmed from a dispute over property and a loan amount. The situation escalated when Sonu and Monu allegedly seized a house belonging to Mahesh Singh. In support of Mukesh Singh, former MLA Anant Singh reached the location, leading to an exchange of gunfire between the two parties, said police. Meanwhile, family members of Sonu and Monu claim the incident was a targeted attack and have urged authorities to conduct a thorough investigation.

The Social Welfare Department has decided to create a separate cadre under which sub-division, district and state-level protection officers will be appointed.
The decision has been taken in view of the rising number of domestic violence cases in the state. Speaking to PTI, Harjot Kaur Bamhrah, additional chief secretary of the Social Welfare Department and chairman cum MD of Bihar Women and Child Development Corporation, said, ""The department has decided to appoint full-time POs to effectively deal with cases of domestic violence.""
""The process will start soon. A separate cadre will be created for the purpose... More than 140 POs will be appointed across the state. Of them, 101 will be appointed at the sub-division level and 38 at the district level. A state-level PO will also be appointed,"" she added.
The decision has been taken as per the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, she said. ""The move aims to provide more effective protection of the rights of women, guaranteed under the Constitution, to victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto,"" Bamhrah said.
As per the Act, the PO will assist the magistrate in the discharge of his functions and the former will also be responsible to get the aggrieved person medically examined, if she has sustained bodily injuries and forward a copy of the medical report to the police station and the magistrate having jurisdiction in the area where the domestic violence is alleged to have been taken place, she said.
The PO will also ensure that the order for monetary relief under Section 20 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is complied with and executed, in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the existing law, she added.
The state government has already taken several steps to ensure justice for women facing domestic violence through the enactment ofthe Dowry Prohibition Act, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, among others, Bamhrah said, adding that different schemes also provide various kinds of services to women who face domestic violence.
The number of cases registered and disposed of relating to crimes committed against women increased in 2022-23, when compared to the previous year, according to the Bihar Economic Survey report (2023-24) released by the state government last year.

Pradeep Kumar, Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), Mohania (Kaimur) said, ""The Jamui-bound jeep collided with a parked truck. While two people died on the spot, another succumbed to injuries during treatment. Four others suffered injuries.""
A case has been registered, and further investigation is underway. Authorities are working to ascertain the identity of the deceased, he added.
Just three days before the Kumbh Mela comes to its culmination, Uttar Pradesh Chief MinisterYogi Adityanathsaid on Sunday that 62 crore devotees have come to the Mahakumbh so far and the gathering of such a large number of people during a certain period is in itself ""one of the rarest events of the century"".
Mahakumbh Mela 2025 is being held in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj in full grandeur as crores of devotees take a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam every day.
He emphasised that the Kumbh would serve as a powerful medium to re-establish that vital connection, bringing the people back to their spiritual roots and cultural heritage.
This year’s Mahakumbh is especially auspicious, as seers and astrologers claim that the celestial alignments and cosmic combinations occurring during the event are rare, happening only once every 144 years. This rare astrological occurrence has added an extra layer of spiritual importance to the gathering, making it even more meaningful for the millions of pilgrims who have travelled to Prayagraj.
Held once every 12 years, the Mahakumbh Mela is not only a religious event but a symbol of India’s deep spiritual and cultural roots. For many, taking the holy dip at the Sangam is a lifelong aspiration, one that brings a sense of spiritual fulfilment and connection to the divine. As the Mahakumbh continues, the spirit of faith, unity, and devotion is evident at every corner of the grand mela.

""The President was not tired at any point. Indeed, she has believed that speaking up for the marginalized communities, for women and farmers, as she was doing during the course of her address, can never be tiring. The President's office believes it might be the case that these leaders have not acquainted themselves with the idiom and discourse in Indian languages such as Hindi, and thus formed a wrong impression.

How a secret communication got leaked before the media, if party wants they should get it probed"". Vij said even before he received a copy of the notice he came to know about it through the media.
The BJP on Monday served the notice to the 71-year-old Vij on the instructions of the BJP national president and the party had sought a written reply from the minister within three days.
In the notice issued to Vij on Monday, Badoli said, ""It is informed that you have recently made public statements against the party (state) president (Badoli) and the chief minister's post. These are serious allegations and are against the party's policy and internal discipline"".
""We expect you to give a written explanation on this subject within three days,"" it mentioned.
Speaking in Ambala on January 31, Vij expressed his frustration over the lack of action against those who allegedly worked against him in the elections. He stated, ""I had submitted a written complaint against those who tried to defeat me—be it officials, employees, or small-time leaders. It has been 100 days, yet neither have I been asked about it nor has any action been taken. I suspect that someone big was behind this conspiracy to defeat me."" ""Taking a direct jab at CM Saini, Vij added, ""Since becoming Chief Minister, he has been constantly flying in 'udankhatola'... He should come down and look at the public. This is not just my voice, it is the voice of all MLAs and ministers,"" Vij alleged.
Last month Vij said Mohan Lal Badoli should resign from the post of state BJP chief to maintain the ""sanctity"" of the party till he is found innocent. His statement came after Badoli was booked in connection with a gang rape case.  Badoli and singer Rocky Mittal were booked after a woman alleged that she was raped by them in a hotel in Himachal Pradesh's Kasauli. Police had registered an FIR against them.

He had previously resigned from his position as the governor of Odisha on December 24 to re-enter active politics, following the party's defeat in the assembly elections, where it was unable to unseat the JNM-led coalition from power in the state.
Das was given a warm welcome at the BJP's state headquarters in the presence of the party's state unit president Babulal Marandi, working president Ravindra Rai, Union minister Sanjay Seth, and hundreds of supporters. Speaking on the occasion, Das said that he was happy to take the membership of the party for the second time since 1980 and he would serve the people.
He had to quit the party after assuming the position of the Odisha governor in 2023. ""In the 2024 assembly polls, all party members, right from the state president to booth level workers, made their honest effort but we did not get the desired results. We should not be disheartened by the results. We will come back soon,"" Das said.
The party faced a major setback in the 2024 Jharkhand assembly elections, managing to win only 21 seats, despite an all-out blitz. The JMM-led alliance stormed to power for the second consecutive term, winning 56 seats in the 81-member assembly.
""People of Jharkhand have given their mandate to the alliance government. We respect the mandate and hope the government will fulfill the promises made to the people. We will give two-three months to them to fulfill their promises. If the government fails to do it, we will launch our struggle on the streets,"" he said.
Das, who was the first non-tribal chief minister of Jharkhand from 2014-2019, was appointed the governor of Odisha on October 18, 2023 after the party's defeat in the 2019 assembly polls in the state.
Das had joined the BJP as a worker and then gradually rose through the party ranks before getting the first break when he was nominated as party candidate from Jamshedpur (East) in the 1995 assembly elections in undivided Bihar.
He went on to win the seat five times. He became a minister for the first time in the Babulal Marandi government after the creation of Jharkhand and got berths in the subsequent two governments led byArjun Munda, before becoming the deputy chief minister in the Shibu Soren-led government in 2009.

In between, he is heard telling villagers surrounding him to maintain silence so that he could speak to the official without disturbance. After communicating the message, the pilot handed over the phone to a villager sitting nearby.
When villagers offered medical assistance to the pilot writhing in pain, he told them that a vehicle was coming to ferry them to hospital. The pilot then asks villagers to find out about his 'banda' (co-pilot).
The twin-seater trainer aircraft, which was on a routine sortie, caught fire after crashing at around 2.40 pm, said a Central Air Command spokesperson. The fighter jet had taken off from the Gwalior Airbase.
Both pilots on board the aircraft ejected safely but suffered minor injuries and were airlifted to Gwalior by a helicopter, officials said. The pilots were admitted to a hospital in Gwalior, the spokesperson said.

                                    A Jungle Book moment: Tiger and wild boar rescued from well in Madhya Pradesh | Watch",2025-02-05T15:57:35+05:30,"The wild is full of extraordinary encounters, and sometimes even the fiercest of creatures must confront an unexpected challenge. This was the case in Madhya Pradesh’s Seoni district, where a dramatic, almost surreal incident unfolded that could easily be a scene from The Jungle Book. A tiger and a wild boar locked in a fierce chase were inadvertently trapped in a deep well, forcing them to temporarily set aside their instincts as predators and prey.
The intense chase, which had been playing out in the lush Jikurai forest range, took an unexpected turn when both animals plunged into the well in Pipariya Harduli village. The discovery was made by locals who had come to fetch water. Initially stunned by the sight of the two animals stuck together, the villagers quickly alerted wildlife authorities.
A swift rescue operation led by the Pench Tiger Reserve soon followed, using a hydraulic crane to lower a cot into the well. With caution and care, the tigress climbed onto the cot, eventually joined by the wild boar. The four-hour-long operation was a success, and both animals were freed unharmed. The Pench Tiger Reserve shared the heartwarming video of the rescue on social media, which quickly went viral, with users expressing both awe and gratitude for the team's efforts.

The heart of the incident lies in the moment when predator and prey, united in their shared struggle for survival, rested together in the confined space of the well. In that fleeting moment, the laws of the jungle seemed to pause. As one Instagram user noted, ""Nature’s game"" had taken a new twist—life, in its rawest form, was the true winner.
This event highlights not only the raw beauty of the animal kingdom but also the importance of safeguarding wildlife habitats. In light of the rescue, officials have called for local wells in forest areas to be covered or fenced off to prevent future mishaps. The jungle, as it seems, is always full of surprises.",,madhya-pradesh,

He was in conversation with industrialists in connection with the 'Invest Madhya Pradesh - Global Investors Summit' to be held in Bhopal on February 24 and 25. On Tuesday, the cabinet headed by CM Yadav approved the Madhya Pradesh Civil Aviation Policy-2025.
Speaking about the new policy, the CM said, ""As per the policy, a pucca helipad will be built in every 45 km radius and an airport in every 150 km radius across the state."" He added that his government will provide aviation companies with a grant of Rs 7.50 lakh on every new domestic flight connecting Madhya Pradesh to other states of the country through new routes and Rs 10 lakh on every new international flight.
He also said that soon the tenders will be called to start helicopter service to connect Indore, Ujjain and Omkareshwar.
The cabinet has also approved the new Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Development Policy of the state. Highlighting various provisions of the policy, the CM said that the interests of those who set up a small industry with an investment of more than Rs 2.50 crore will also be protected.
Industrial areas developed by industrialists at the private level will also get all the benefits and facilities, which are provided to industrial areas developed by the state government, Yadav said.

                                    MP dam project will submerge forested areas used as critical tiger corridor: NTCA warns ",2025-02-09T14:31:20+05:30,"The construction of the Morand-Ganjal Irrigation Project in Madhya Pradesh will lead to the submersion of the forested areas used by tigers to move between reserves, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) warned.  It recommended exploring alternative sites, as per government records.
The Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) under the Environment Ministry discussed a proposal to divert 2,250.05 hectares of forest land for the project at a meeting on January 27.
The project involves building two dams on the Morand and Ganjal rivers to improve irrigation in Hoshangabad, Betul, Harda, and Khandwa districts of the state.
According to NTCA,  the project will destroy a crucial tiger corridor between the Satpura and Melghat Tiger Reserves and pose a threat to other wildlife and biodiversity.
The NTCA's analysis, based on the National Tiger Estimation 2022, shows that the project site is part of a critical tiger-occupied habitat. It said the dams would submerge forested areas essential for tiger movement between reserves, affecting ""genetic exchange and population stability"".
""Any disruption to this ecological connectivity will likely have long-term detrimental impacts on the viability of tiger populations and the broader wildlife community within this landscape,"" the NTCA said.
NTCA said that both the Satpura and Melghat reserves are in a recovery phase, with tiger populations increasing after voluntary village relocations. It warned that losing this corridor could reverse those gains.
The NTCA has strongly recommended exploring alternative sites to minimise environmental damage.
""Selecting less ecologically sensitive locations for such projects can help strike a balance between developmental needs and the conservation of critical wildlife habitats. Ensuring the long-term preservation of biodiversity and the ecological integrity of this landscape must remain a top priority,"" it said.

The announcement was made on Monday at an event in Pipalrawa village, Dewas district, where Rs 1,553 crore was transferred to the accounts of 1.27 crore women beneficiaries.
Addressing the gathering, CM Yadav reassured women that the scheme would continue without any disruption. Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, ""The Congress has been spreading lies across the country, claiming that our government would stop these payments after one or two months. But we will leave no stone unturned in fulfilling our promises.""
He also added that in addition to the present Rs 1,250 benefit, the government is giving gas cylinders at Rs 450 to 74 lakh women. He also promised beneficiaries that the monetary benefit would be increased gradually up to Rs 3,000.

At the program, CM Yadav also transferred:
Additionally, he inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for 53 development projects worth Rs 144.84 crore.
Madhya Pradesh Congress President Jitu Patwari criticised the announcement, calling it an unfulfilled promise. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he accused the BJP government of making repeated declarations without actual implementation.
He claimed that the number of Ladli Behna Yojana beneficiaries has decreased from 1.31 crore in October 2023 to 1.27 crore in February 2025, alleging that new beneficiaries are not being added while existing names are being removed. Patwari compared CM Yadav to former CMShivraj Singh Chouhan, accusing him of misleading women with false promises.
The announcement marks a major policy shift in Madhya Pradesh's welfare schemes, with political debates intensifying ahead of upcoming elections.

                                    34 Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankan Navy, Tamil Nadu CM Stalin flags matter with Centre",2025-01-26T22:18:06+05:30,"As many as 34 Indian fishermen including 32 from Tamil Nadu and two from Kerala have been arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy while they were fishing near Dhanushkodi in Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister MK Stalin said on Sunday and urged the Centre to take action for their immediate release.
These fishermen had ventured for fishing from the Rameswaram fishing harbour in three mechanised fishing boats and were arrested on January 25, along with their boats, Stalin told External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday.
""They were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy while they were fishing near Dhanushkodi on 25.01.2025. The frequent detentions of our fishermen has put the coastal communities into a perpetual sense of anxiety and apprehension, as their future is made uncertain and bleak. It is high time concrete diplomatic steps are taken to prevent our fishermen from being arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy,"" Stalin said.
""I therefore request you to take necessary urgent action through diplomatic channels to prevent the arrests of our fishermen and to secure the immediate release of all the arrested fishermen and their fishing boats from the Sri Lankan authorities,"" he added.
Both arrests came off the coast of the northeastern Mannar district in the Navy’s continued regular patrols in the Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing, the Navy said. The arrested fishermen have been handed over to the relevant officials for further action.
The Indian High Commission here earlier this week said some 41 Indian fishermen who had been similarly arrested previously for poaching in Sri Lankan waters were repatriated. On January 12, eight Indian fishermen were arrested and two fishing trawlers were seized.
The fishermen issue is a contentious one in the ties between India and Sri Lanka, with Lankan Navy personnel even firing at Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats in several alleged incidents of illegally entering Sri Lankan territorial waters.
The Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries.
Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other's waters. In 2024, the island nation's Navy arrested 529 Indian fishermen for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters.

The transfer occurred on Friday, a day after a Bengaluru court ordered the handover of the assets, which had previously been under the custody of Karnataka.
Karnataka authorities were in possession of an extensive collection of valuables, including 27 kg and 558 grams of gold jewellery, 1,116 kg of silver, and documents related to 1,526 acres of land. These assets had been stored securely in the Karnataka Vidhana Soudha treasury. The transfer was carried out in the presence of court and government officials.
The items were documented and photographed during the transfer process. Among the images, an opulent golden crown with intricate craftsmanship stands out, reflecting the grandeur associated with Jayalalithaa’s tenure. Additionally, a vast collection of jewellery was catalogued, with rows of ornate ornaments laid out for inventory. A sword with elaborate engravings also featured among the high-value objects, adding to the list of remarkable items recovered.
The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a plea filed by Jayalalithaa's niece, who is also her legal heir, seeking the return of the properties confiscated in a case against her. On January 29, a special CBI court ordered the transfer of all confiscated assets belonging to Jayalalithaa to the Tamil Nadu government.
The decision came after the Karnataka High Court on January 13 dismissed a plea by Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew, J Deepa and J Deepak, who staked claim to the properties as her legal heirs.
Jayalalithaa was convicted in the DA case, where she was found guilty of amassing wealth beyond her known sources of income. The top court upheld the confiscation of her properties despite abating proceedings against her following her demise in 2016. Her heirs argued that since the case against Jayalalithaa was abated, her assets should not be confiscated.

Asserting his rejection to the Centre's policy, Stalin said he would not agree to implement it even if the Centre offered to provide Rs 10,000 crore in funds to the state.
He further said that his government oppose NEP not only because it is an attempt to impose Hindi but also because it has serious consequences for the students.
Staling was addressing an event organised by the Parents-Teachers Association in Tamil Nadu's Cuddalore where he said apart from encouraging a screening test for admissions to even arts and science colleges, similar to the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical courses, the NEP would allow students to discontinue their studies.
""Permitting students to discontinue studies is akin to asking them not to study. We are not opposed to any language but will remain firm in opposing its imposition. We are not opposing the NEP only for the attempt to thrust Hindi but for several other reasons as well. The NEP is regressive. It will drive students away from schools,"" Stalin claimed.
Apart from 'denying' financial aid to SC/ST and BC students, which is now being provided, the NEP proposed public exams for third, fifth, and eighth standards, besides introducing a common entrance test for admissions to arts and science colleges, the Chief Minister said.
""The Centre says Tamil Nadu will get Rs 2,000 crore if the state implements the NEP. I wish to say that we will not agree to the NEP even if the Centre offers Rs 10,000 crore. I will not allow the NEP and commit the sin of pushing Tamil Nadu backward by 2,000 years,"" Stalin said.

The protest comes in response to commission rates ranging from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, which drivers claim severely impact their earnings.
As per media reports, this indefinite strike is due to the frustration over the hefty commissions charged by ride-hailing aggregators like Ola and Uber, which range from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of their earnings. Drivers argue that these deductions make it difficult for them to sustain their livelihoods, pay rent, clear loans and support their families.
Zahir Hussain A, coordinator of the Confederation of Drivers’ Unions in Chennai, talked about the long-standing demand for a fare revision.
""We have been asking for this for 12 years, as directed by the Madras High Court, but the government has not acted. The transport minister keeps saying the proposal is awaiting cabinet approval,"" he said during a press briefing.
As per report, instead of commissions, drivers plan to operate through alternatives like Namma Yatri, which charges a fixed daily subscription fee. Auto drivers unaffiliated with any app-based service have proposed a new fare system- Rs 50 as a base fare, followed by Rs 18 per km.
Hussain also pointed out the challenges drivers face under current conditions. ""With commissions as high as 40per cent, we are sometimes forced to charge above the app-estimated fares, leading to conflicts with passengers. We have no choice but to strike. We need to sustain our livelihoods, pay rent, clear loans, and support our children’s education,"" he added.
The announcement has sparked mixed reactions.

The state government on Monday said that it has stepped up measures to conserve the Olive Ridley turtles.
The Olive Ridley turtle nesting in the coastal areas will be monitored and protected, the government said, and warned fishermen of stringent action if they were found using trawl nets within five nautical miles (9.26 km) in the coastal areas of Chennai, Chengalpattu, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, and Kanyakumari districts.
A special task force has been formed with representatives from the Indian Coast Guard, Fisheries and Forest Departments, Marine Fisheries Regulatory Division, and the Tamil Nadu Coast Guard under the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to exchange information on sea turtle movement/breeding and ensure conducive atmosphere for the sea turtles to breed.
The carcasses of at least 60 turtles were found on the Kovalam beach recently. As per a preliminary estimate, about 500 turtles were found dead from Neelankarai to Uthandi and Alamparaikuppam, and around 400 between Marina and Besant Nagar beaches.
""At least over 1,000 turtles have been washed ashore dead since the past few days and this is very disturbing,"" a forest department official said.

Though the exact cause of death was being probed, it was suspected that trawl nets used by some fishing vessels could have caused their deaths.
An environmentalist said an analysis of the carcasses indicated signs of drowning. ""The popped eyes and bulged necks indicate that they have died due to drowning,"" he said.
""The Olive Ridley turtle population is facing a critical threat. The combination of habitat destruction and accidental entanglement in fishing nets has led to a drastic decline in their numbers,"" says The Tree Foundation representative Supraja Dharini.
During 2023-2024, the Forest Department, in collaboration with volunteers and NGOs, collected 2,58,907 turtle eggs, set up hatcheries and protected them, and returned 2,15,778 turtle hatchlings to the sea.

Being held after 12 years, the Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will continue till February 26 on the banks of the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers, considered holy among Hindus.
The Mahakumbh, which is held every 12 years, is witnessing an unprecedented turnout in 2025. Drone footage from the Triveni Sangam has showcased the vast crowds of pilgrims gathering at the ghats to perform the sacred ritual, which is believed to cleanse sins and bring spiritual liberation, or moksha.
This year’s Mahakumbh is especially auspicious, as seers and astrologers claim that the celestial alignments and cosmic combinations occurring during the event are rare, happening only once every 144 years. This rare astrological occurrence has added an extra layer of spiritual importance to the gathering, making it even more meaningful for the millions of pilgrims who have travelled to Prayagraj.
Held once every 12 years, the Mahakumbh Mela is not only a religious event but a symbol of India’s deep spiritual and cultural roots. For many, taking the holy dip at the Sangam is a lifelong aspiration, one that brings a sense of spiritual fulfilment and connection to the divine. As the Mahakumbh continues, the spirit of faith, unity, and devotion is evident at every corner of the grand mela.

Welcoming all the guests at the Unicorn Companies Conclave in Agra, Chief Minister Yogi said, ""I can call it the Unicorn Mahakumbh of the startup world. There is an attraction towards the Mahakumbh at this time.""
He said, ""This is important for me. Today, I have come to Braj Bhoomi, behind which there has been a spiritual and cultural background. It has influenced India's civilisation and culture for a long time.''

Chief Minister Adityanath while talking about the devotees coming to the Mahakumbh this time, said that so far 62 crore devotees have come to the event.
''I think that in any event in the world, whether it is spiritual or for any tourism purpose, the gathering of such a large number of people during a certain period of time in that ceremony and being united with that event is in itself one of the rarest events of the century,'' he said.
Adityanath, who is also the Mahant of the Gorakshapeeth, remarked that it must have been envisioned that a time would come when people in India might feel disconnected from their traditions and culture.
He emphasised that the Kumbh would serve as a powerful medium to re-establish that vital connection, bringing the people back to their spiritual roots and cultural heritage.

As per the officials, the incident took place around 1:45 pm between Toymeta and Kawanar villages when a joint team of DRG and district force from Chhote Dongar police station was out patrolling for a road security operation.
Maoists often plant IEDs along roads and dirt tracks in the forest to target security personnel during patrolling in interior pockets of the Bastar region, comprising seven districts including Narayanpur. When the patrolling team was cordoning off the area, a DRG jawan inadvertently stepped over the pressure IED, triggering a blast which left him injured, he said.
On February 15, a commando of CRPF’s elite CoBRA unit was injured when a pressure IED planted by Naxalites went off in Bijapur district, while a jawan from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was injured in a similar incident in Sukma district on February 11. As per the officials, the injured constable was administered preliminary treatment and airlifted to Raipur for further care. His condition was out of danger.

An IED planted by Naxals, was defused by security officials in Bijapur. The remote-controlled IED under a culvert near Timapur Durga temple on Basaguda-Awapalli Road was detected by the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) of the 168th battalion of the CRPF when it was out on de-mining exercise, an official said.
The Naxalites had removed some stones and cement to create a cavity for the IED which was then covered with stones, he said. But the metal detector found it, the police official added. The BDS first tried to remove it safely, but since the IED was planted deep under the surface, it was neutralised through a controlled explosion, he said.

The culvert was damaged in the process and was being repaired to enable resumption of traffic, the official said. The IED could be activated through a remote control and Naxalites have used this mechanism in the past, the official said.
On January 6, Naxalites blew up a vehicle with an IED in the district, killing eight police personnel and their civilian driver. On Wednesday, security forces recovered eight IEDs, weighing five kg each, from Gangaloor police station area of the district.
The Maoists plant IEDs along the roads and dirt tracks to target security personnel during patrolling in interior pockets of Bastar region comprising seven districts including Bijapur. IEDs have also claimed civilian casualties in the region.

The court, while delivering justice, termed the crime as ""extremely depraved, disgusting, bestial, and cowardly"" that shook the collective conscience of society.
The convicts, identified as—Santram Manjhwar, Abdul Jabbar, Anil Kumar Sarthi, Pardeshi Ram, and Anand Ram Panika—were found guilty under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 302 (murder) and 376(2)(G) (gang rape), along with provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act by the Fast Track Special Court in Korba district.
However, a sixth accused, named Umashanakar Yadav, was sentenced to life imprisonment due to medical reasons. It was determined that he had undergone surgery that affected his ability to participate in the crime. Nevertheless, the death sentences will still require confirmation from the Chhattisgarh High Court before being carried out.
The heart-wrenching incident took place on January 9, 2021, when the 16-year-old girl was gang raped in front of her father before being murdered. The horrific crime left the court with no option but to choose the death penalty rather than the general rule of life imprisonment, the judge said.
The ruling noted that accused Santram and Abdul Jabbar raped the deceased girl while the remaining accused played an active role in this act by supporting them. ""This inhuman and cruel act of the accused is extremely depraved, disgusting, bestial and cowardly as they killed three innocent and weak persons to satisfy their lust. This act has hurt the collective conscience of the entire society,"" the court said.
The accused had also killed a three-and-a-half-year-old girl and the father aged around 55-60 years. The horrific incident took place when the victims—residents of the Pahadi Korwa tribal community—were travelling home after being offered a lift by Manjhwar, the employer of the 16-year-old girl's father since July 2020.
As per the prosecution, they stopped at Korai village, and Manjhwar consumed liquor, following which the other men also joined him. The men took the trio to the foothill surrounded by forest near Gadhuproda. The accused gang-raped the 16-year-old in front of her father.
After the gruesome act, the accused bludgeoned the girl with stones and left her in the forest leading to her death near Gadhuproda village under Lemru police station area of Korba district. After killing all the victims with stones and sticks, the accused dumped them in the forest before fleeing from the scene, police said.
Four days later, the deceased man's son approached the Lemru police station saying three family members were missing. The cops swung into action and rounded up the six men on February 2, they said. After questioning, police reached the crime site the same day and found the raped victim alive and two others dead. The rape victim died while being rushed to a local hospital, police said.

Amidst these two monumental landmarks, the tableau vividly illustrates Gujarat’s remarkable advancements in diverse sectors such as defence, automobiles, technology, and manufacturing, highlighting its role in realising the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India).
The tableau also honours Gujarat’s ‘Tribal Pride’ with Pithora paintings along with commemorating the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee with the ‘Atal Bridge,’ an engineering marvel at the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad.
It also highlights Gujarat’s emerging Underwater Sports initiatives at Dwarika and Shivrajpur Beach. In the foreground of the tableau, the 12th-century Solanki-era ‘Kirti Toran’ from Anartpur (modern-day Vadnagar) is depicted which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Surrounding it are intricate Kutchhi clay-glazed artworks and Pithora paintings, which honour the tribal god ‘Baba Pithora.’ Prominently displayed next is a key initiative of Atmanirbhar Bharat: the C-295 aircraft unit, which will be produced by Tata Advanced Systems Limited in Vadodara for the Indian Air Force. Below this, the tableau showcases the ‘Atal Bridge,’ a technological marvel that connects the two ends of the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. Further highlighted are Gujarat’s strategic investments in semiconductor manufacturing and its emerging role as a hub for automobile production.
The tableau’s final section showcases the majestic 182-meter ‘Statue of Unity,’ a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the world’s tallest statue. Constructed using iron collected from farmers across India, this monumental structure commemorates the 150th birth anniversary of India’s first Deputy Prime Minister. At the base of the statue, the tableau emphasizes Gujarat’s upcoming Underwater Sports initiatives at the revered Jagatmandir Dwarka and Shivrajpur Beach. The visual content for this tableau is provided by the Discovery channel. Enhancing the tableau’s visual appeal will be Gujarat’s vibrant Maniyara Raas, brought to life with the dynamic rhythm of traditional yet modern Duha music.
This year, a total of 30 tableaus will be featured in the Republic Day parade, including 14 from states and union territories, as well as contributions from various central government departments. The President of the Republic of Indonesia, Mr Prabowo Subianto, will grace the 76th Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest.

The cold has not deterred tourists who rush to the valley to be mesmerised by Kashmir's beauty during winter.
Mahesh, a tourist from Gurgaon, says, ""The atmosphere is great, and there's no trouble of any kind. People are enjoying themselves. We visited Sonmarg, and it was covered in snow, attracting a huge crowd. Initially, we had concerns about the situation here, but everything is perfectly fine. It’s a wonderful experience.""
Mahesh's remarks highlighted the increasing tourist appeal of Kashmir during the winter. Encouraging more visitors, he added, “People should come and experience the beauty of Kashmir—it truly is India’s most beautiful destination.”
The India Meteorological Department has forecasted that the weather would be generally dry in Jammu and Kashmir until February 8, though light rain/snow was likely in isolated areas on February 9.
Although the temperatures are low, no significant snowfall is expected during this period. Tourists and locals should make appropriate plans.
Apart from the capital city, Srinagar, fresh snowfall has hit Jammu and Kashmir's Doda district largely at higher places. The state had already reeled under widespread snowfall of February 4 and 5, which went on to melt further and made the temperature remain low. But the locals believe that this has been one less snowy winter by far. Whatever the case maybe, they want better weather soon to attract plenty of tourists around.
At the same time, Himachal Pradesh's favorite hill stations have become winter wonderlands, starting with Manali and Kullu. Heavy snowfall, fresh spell in the region has enhanced the area's charm by attracting visitors interested in witnessing snow-covered landscapes of breathtaking beauty.
The minimum temperature was reported by IMD to have stood at 2.6 degree celsius at 8:30 AM today and hence adds chill. It seems like everyone enjoys the bewitching beauty of snow-crowned mountains; everyone seems to have come here just to relish this winter.

The robbers made off with a staggering Rs 19.56 lakh in cash. According to sources, the robbers' identities remain unknown, and they fled the scene in broad daylight, taking the large sum of money with them.
The police swung into action immediately following the robbery. The station house officer (SHO) reached the bank to start the inquiry, and a case was filed at the Dacchan police station. The police are working hard to find the accused. Senior police officials, meanwhile, have confirmed that they are going through the bank CCTV footage that might provide vital evidence in the case.
As per CCTV footage, two masked persons can be seen in the bank at the time of the robbery. Although the possibility of other accomplices has not been ruled out, the authorities are also working on possible terror links that could be involved in the crime. The investigation continues as more information is sought.
Confirming the robbery, Javed Iqbal, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in Jammu and Kashmir, stated that a case had been registered against the unknown persons at the Dacchan police station. He also announced the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) under the supervision of Deputy SP Sumit to investigate the incident thoroughly and get hold of the criminals.
The robbery has also highlighted significant security deficiencies at the bank branch. SSP Iqbal pointed out that the branch lacked basic security measures, such as security personnel on duty at night, and no advanced security infrastructure in place. The bank, located in a remote rural area, only had a lock on the main door, leaving it vulnerable to such crimes.
Authorities have pledged to enhance security measures at local banks in the region to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future.

Apart from the double-decker flyover, Bengaluru will also get an 8-km elevated road which has been proposed on Magadi Road, with the overall cost for these projects estimated at Rs 9,800 crore.
In this regard, Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumarreviewed the plans during his visit to key locations such as Hebbal, BEL Road, Summanahalli, and Goraguntepalya and said that future metro expansions will integrate elevated roads to minimize land acquisition costs.
Officials working on these projects stated that both metro corridors will feature a double-decker design. However, this project delayed the tendering process for metro civil works, despite the central government’s approval in August last year.
As per the report, a significant design modification will be implemented at Goraguntepalya for the 32.15-km metro line between JP Nagar 4th Phase and Kempapura. In this regard, officials are considering a new metro station near Goraguntepalya junction.
These infrastructural developments will reduce construction costs and shorten the metro line by 300 meters. Moreover, to maintain connectivity, dedicated travelators will link the new station to Peenya and Goraguntepalya.

As part of the initial probe, the EOW has recorded the statement of a bank representative to understand the nature and extent of the alleged financial discrepancies.
Authorities are currently analyzing the financial records and transaction details to identify potential lapses or violations. Officials have stated that the investigation is in its early stages and efforts are being made to determine where the irregularities occurred.
A day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a six-month transaction ban on New India Co-operative Bank Ltd, anxious customers rushed to its branches on Friday, seeking clarity on their deposits. The RBI’s action came in response to irregularities in the bank’s lending practices, triggering concerns among account holders about the safety of their savings.

Long queues formed outside the bank’s branches as worried depositors attempted to access their funds. While many were allowed to access lockers containing valuables, cash withdrawals were completely restricted. Notices placed at branch entrances assured depositors that funds would be repaid within 90 days, but that did little to calm their nerves. At several locations, police personnel were deployed to manage the swelling crowds and prevent any law-and-order situation.
A shocking financial fraud has come to light involving the former General Manager of New India Co-operative Bank Ltd., Hitesh Praveenchand Mehta, who is accused of allegedly siphoning off Rs 122 crore from the bank's treasury.
During his tenure, Mehta was responsible for the Dadar and Goregaon branches of the bank. Authorities believe that he misused his position to fraudulently withdraw Rs 122 crore from accounts linked to both branches.
Following a complaint by the bank's chief accounts officer, an FIR has been registered at Dadar Police Station. Investigators suspect that Mehta did not act alone and that another individual may also be involved in the scam.
Considering the magnitude of the fraud, authorities have transferred the case to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for further investigation.
As per the complaint, the fraudulent activities occurred between 2020 and 2025. The Dadar Police have registered the case under Sections 316(5) and 61(2) of the BNS, and a detailed probe is now underway.

The design of the project is likely to be on par with world-renowned offshore airports such as Hong Kong International Airport and Osaka's Kansai International Airport, both built on artificial islands.
The ambitious Vadhvan Airport project has already secured preliminary go-aheads from major government departments, such as the federal environment and defense ministries and the Maharashtra state government. A meeting last month paved the way for feasibility studies, with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to have a key role in the evaluation process.
After conducting feasibility studies, the government will announce an estimated investment cost for the project. The airport will be situated around 125 kilometers away from the country's current international airport in Mumbai, and there is both an opportunity and a challenge when considering infrastructure and passenger demand.
India is rapidly expanding its infrastructure to fill a huge void in transport and logistics networks. The nation with the second-largest infrastructure shortfall globally, after Brazil, is pouring billions of dollars into the creation of highways, airports, and power plants.
The Vadhvan seaport, the country's soon-to-be-biggest and deepest, will serve as a driver of trade and connectivity. An offshore airport that is planned within close distance will facilitate overcoming the issue of land acquisition, an often-repeated hindrance to big-ticket infrastructure projects.
Despite the grand vision, experts have raised concerns about the economic feasibility of the project. Ensuring sufficient passenger traffic will be critical to justify the large-scale investment. While the Modi government’s push for new airports has improved regional connectivity, some newly developed airports in smaller cities have struggled to attract sufficient travelers.
As part of the future connectivity master plan of Mumbai, the Vadhvan airport will serve as the city's third big airport. The new facility will be connected to the government's vision of a high-speed rail corridor, including the planned Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train with a station within close proximity of the airport.
Two of India's biggest interstate highways—the New Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and the Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway—will also connect to the airport to ensure ease of road travel.
With the Adani Group's airport at Navi Mumbai also planned, Mumbai itself is set to be one of India's most well-connected aerial hubs. Nonetheless, mega-size projects such as the Vadhvan offshore airport take more than a decade to materialise and leave doubts hovering over the timescale and overall viability of the ambitious proposal.

The corridor worth Rs 1,100 crore is to ensure smooth connectivity and consists of two elevated corridors. While one corridor would be from the Chirle end of MTHL to Gavan Phata, and another from Palaspe Phata to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway.
The elevated corridor will have six lanes that will pass over the JNPT–Panvel National Highway (NH-348) and will be constructed between Chirle and Gavan Phata, including the reconstruction of service roads. Meanwhile, the MMRDA will also construct a similar six-lane elevated corridor along the Old Mumbai-Pune National Highway (NH-48) in the Raigad district. This corridor will also include widening NH-48 to six lanes.
Metropolitan Commissioner of MMRDA Dr Sanjay Mukherjee IAS has described the project as transformative which emphasises reshaping the regional connectivity and easing traffic congestion, particularly on NH-348.
Mukerjee said, as Indian Express quoted, ""By seamlessly integrating Atal Setu with the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, we are ensuring efficient traffic dispersal and eliminating congestion at crucial junctions, particularly on NH-348, which carries a significant load of multi-axle container traffic from JNPT.""
The elevated corridors will have a combined length of 4,958 metres in the Chirle section and 1,700 metres in the Palaspe section.

As per the information, the incident occurred on the Jaipur-Ajmer Highway near Maukhampura on Thursday afternoon around 3:45 pm.
According to reports, the accident happened when the front tire of the roadways bus burst, causing the driver to lose control. Following this, the bus veered off course and collided head-on with an oncoming car.
Emergency responders and police reached the scene quickly, and the injured were immediately taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, authorities have launched an investigation into the accident.
Deputy Superintendent of Police Deepak Khandelwal said the bus went out of control and hit the car after one of its tyres burst.  Those killed have been identified as Dinesh Kumar Regar, his brother Suresh Regar, Bablu Mewada, Kishan Lal, Ravikant, his brother Babu, Narayan Lal and Pramod Suthar, all residents of Bhilwara district.

The victim named Sanjeev Jat (45) was a resident of Hetamsar village and was admitted to Aruni Hospital in Jhunjhunu on January 23 due to liver problems. His health was improving, but he was found missing from the hospital bed around 4:00 am on January 27. The hospital administration and Sanjeev's family looked for him, but despite searching all day, he was not found. Later on Monday night, Sanjeev's body was found on the roof of another building behind the hospital.
Sanjeev's cousin Hoshiyaar Singh has made serious allegations against the hospital management. He said that Sanjeev was missing since Sunday night, but the hospital neither informed the family nor the police. Hoshiyar Singh alleged that if the hospital had been cautious, Sanjeev's life could have been saved. He has registered a case of Sanjeev's death in the police station.
After Sanjeev's body was found, the angry family members and villagers staged a dharna in front of the hospital. They demanded strict action against the hospital management and doctors and demanded that the hospital be sealed. The angry protesters also refused to take the body, which made the situation even more tense.
Seeing the situation escalating, the administration deployed RAC (Rapid Action Force) personnel to protect the hospital at night. Jhunjhunu Police DSP Virendra Sharma and Kotwali Thanadhikari Narayan Singh talked to the protesters, but the talks were unsuccessful.
The police have registered a case and started an investigation and are trying to find out how Sanjeev disappeared from the hospital and what was the reason behind his death.

The incident followed after Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Avinash Gehlot made a remark in the context of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the Question Hour.
The minister, while answering a question regarding hostels for working women, said, ""In the 2023-24 budget, also, like always, you named the scheme (on working women's hostels) after your 'dadi' (grandmother) Indira Gandhi.""
Moreover, the suspended Congress MLAs have decided to spend the night in the well of the House as arrangements were made for their overnight stay, including bedding and dinner.

The Congress MLAs objected to the remark and stormed to the well, raising slogans and demanding an apology from the minister. Leader of Opposition Tikaram Jully stood up from his seat and demanded that the ""inappropriate word"" be removed from the record.
Laxmangarh MLA and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasara demanded that the statement be expunged and the minister should apologise. He also tried to move close to the speaker during the protest, prompting the marshals to be called.
When the House reassembled at 4 pm after three adjournments, Government Chief Whip Jogeshwar Garg moved a proposal to suspend Congress MLAs Govind Singh Dotasra, Ramkesh Meena, Amin Kagzi, Jakir Hussain, Hakam Ali, and Sanjay Kumar for the remainder of the current Assembly session.
He said that they ""crossed all limits"" and their conduct was ""inappropriate"" towards the Speaker, which cannot be forgiven. The House passed the proposal by a voice vote, following which Speaker Vasudev Devnani adjourned the House until 11 am on February 24.
This led to the suspension of six Congress MLAs from the remainder of the Budget Session, which has been attributed to the unruly behaviour of the opposition members.

For the past few months, she had remained largely absent from party programs, meetings, and even assembly sessions. However, her sudden surge in political activity has been noticeable, as she is now actively engaging with key leaders.
Two days ago, in an unexpected move, Raje visited the Rajasthan Assembly in the evening and met with the Speaker. Last month, Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma also paid a visit to her residence, where the two held a half-hour discussion.
Additionally, Raje recently travelled to Delhi, where she met several senior party leaders. She has also been seen meeting her supporters under the pretext of religious visits, a strategy she has employed in the past to reconnect with her political base.
Earlier, Raje urged party leaders and workers to set aside factionalism and work together with unity and discipline to strengthen the organisation. Speaking at an event on February 22, marking Madan Rathore’s formal appointment as BJP’s Rajasthan state president, Raje emphasised the need for collective effort to ensure the party's success. She stated that if Rathore's tenure is to be successful, everyone must work together without divisions to effectively establish the party at the grassroots level.
Highlighting Rajasthan’s unique political landscape, she expressed confidence that just as the BJP has nurtured a strong organizational structure, the entire state could be united as one political family. Raje also advised Rathore to include capable, responsible, and ideologically committed workers in his team to advance the party’s mission in their respective areas.
Vasundhara Raje is known for her calculated moves in politics. Whenever she plans something significant, she ensures visibility by meeting leaders and supporters, signalling her resurgence in the political arena.

The teams in the accident site at Nagarkurnool district, about 150 km from here, called out the names of the trapped people, but there was no response, sources said.
The rescue personnel were able to reach up to the 13th km inside the tunnel, a short distance from where the mishap occurred around 8.30 am on Saturday.

Earlier on Sunday morning, rescue operations at the tunnel faced a roadblock as the SDRF and NDRF teams encountered severe challenges in accessing the collapsed section of the tunnel. Eight workers are feared trapped after a three-meter section of the roof of an under-construction stretch of the tunnel caved in near Telangana’s Nagarkurnool district.
""There's no chance to go to the spot inside the tunnel. It has completely collapsed and mud is reaching up to the knees. We will have to take another step,"" an SDRF official said. SDRF, NDRF and other rescue teams, along with officials from Singareni Collieries, returned after inspecting the collapsed portion tunnel, in which at least eight workers are feared trapped, while few had managed to escape.

The collapse occurred just four days after construction work had resumed following a lengthy hiatus. In response, NDRF and SDRF teams were deployed to the site, while an Engineer Regiment of the Indian Army, part of the Infantry Division at Secunderabad, was placed on standby with an Excavator Dozer to support the rescue efforts, said the army. The ETF is equipped with specialist engineering teams, a Medical detachment from the Field Ambulance of the Army Medical Corps, an ambulance, three high-capacity pumping sets, armoured hoses, and other accessories.
Reacting to the incident, Congress MP from Nagarkurnool, Mallu Ravi told ANI, ""A very bad incident happened in the SLBC tunnel. The roof collapsed here. Around 60 people were working. Except 8, all others have come out safely without any serious injuries.""
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called Telangana Chief Minister ARevanth Reddyto inquire about the tunnel collapse incident and assured all possible assistance from the Centre for the ongoing rescue operation.
Reddy briefed the Prime Minister on the situation, informing him that efforts were already underway to rescue the trapped individuals, according to a release from the Chief Minister's Office (CMO).",,telangana,

The apex court dismissed the transfer while hearing a plea filed by Andhra Pradesh Deputy Speaker Raghu Rama Krishna Raju of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). In his plea, Raju had alleged that the state machinery was being manipulated in favour of the former CM.
A division bench comprising Justices BV Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma observed that transferring the matter was unwarranted since the High Court is monitoring the case before the concerned CBI court, which has been directed to conduct hearings on a day-to-day basis.
Initially, the petition was filed in 2023 when Raju was a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the YSR Congress Party. The plea was directed against his party leader and former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. However, in March 2024, Raju switched parties and joined the TDP.
As per his petition, the former CM had illegally amassed wealth amounting to Rs 40,000 crores and ensured that the criminal trials against him remained dormant, with no significant progress.
The plea said, ""Shockingly, the state machinery has been more than happy to act as silent spectators to this abuse of the judicial process, turning criminal trials into friendly matches between the accused and the prosecution.""

According to officials, the state government conducted the largest-ever Socio-Economic, Educational, Employment, Political, and Caste (SEEEPC) survey, covering 96.9 per cent of households in just 50 days.
From passing a resolution in the Cabinet to submitting the final report, the entire process was completed within exactly one year.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee, chaired by Minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy, formally received the survey reports from the Planning Department, which spearheaded the massive data collection exercise.
The minister hailed it as a historic initiative and a revolutionary step in achieving social justice, emphasising that the findings will guide policy decisions to uplift the Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other marginalised communities.
Addressing a press conference, Uttam Kumar Reddy recalled that on February 4, 2024, the Telangana Cabinet approved the survey, and now, exactly one year later, the report stands as a milestone in governance and policymaking.
Uttam Kumar Reddy described it as a ""historic day"" for social justice in Telangana and announced that the reports would be presented before the Cabinet on February 4 at 10 AM, followed by a short discussion in the Assembly on the same day.
This marked a significant step towards data-driven governance, fulfilling a major promise made by Congress leaderRahul Gandhiduring the 2023 Telangana Assembly elections.
The Congress government, led by Chief MinisterRevanth Reddyand Deputy Chief Minister Bhatti Vikramarka have now laid the foundation for welfare policies based on real-time socio-economic data.
At a high-level meeting, Ministers Uttam Kumar Reddy, D Seethakka, Ponnam Prabhakar, and Damodar Raja Narasimha received the survey reports from Principal Secretary (Planning) Sandeep Kumar Sultania, State Nodal Officer and Hyderabad Collector Anudeep Durishetty, and other senior officials. The Planning Department made a detailed PowerPoint presentation on the methodology and findings.
This comprehensive survey, the largest post-independence, covered 96.9 per cent of Telangana households with the help of 94,863 enumerators and 9,628 supervisors deployed across 94,261 Enumeration Blocks.
A total of 76,000 data entry operators digitised the information within 36 days. The Centre for Good Governance developed the digital infrastructure for smooth execution. The first respondent was Telangana Governor Jishnu Dev Varma, who officially launched the survey by participating on November 9, 2024.
Covering 3,54,77,554 individuals, the survey revealed crucial demographic data: BCs accounted for 1,64,09,179 people (46.25 per cent), SCs 61,84,319 (17.43 per cent), STs 37,05,929 (10.45 per cent), and the total Muslim population stood at 44,57,012 (12.56 per cent), including 35,76,588 (10.08 per cent) BC Muslims and 8,80,424 (2.48 per cent) OC Muslims.
Other OCs accounted for 44,21,115 (13.31 per cent), making the total OC population 15.79 per cent. Uttam Kumar Reddy stated that the findings would be used to restructure Telangana's welfare programmes to ensure equitable distribution of resources.
Uttam Reddy acknowledged that the survey faced significant challenges, including misinformation campaigns where false propaganda attempted to mislead the public. Legal hurdles also arose, as PILs were filed against the survey, but the High Court ruled in favour of the government, allowing the process to continue. Among the key operational challenges, 1.03 lakh houses were found locked, 1.68 lakh families were initially hesitant to participate, and 84,137 houses were misclassified due to non-residential usage or occupants being non-Telangana residents.
The government conducted repeated awareness campaigns and field visits to ensure maximum participation and accuracy in data collection.

According to civic officials, the tragedy occurred during excavation for the cellar, when soil erosion caused a section of the earth to fall on the workers.
The workers, aged between 21 and 50, were part of a family from Khammam district in Telangana. The workers were trapped under debris after a layer of the excavation wall collapsed, as initially reported by the police. A rescue operation was launched immediately, with personnel from the Disaster Response Force (DRF) and local police joining civic officials at the scene.
Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials later confirmed that the soil erosion took place at the corner of the excavated portion, leading to the collapse that claimed the lives of three workers. The injured worker was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.
The building under construction had obtained permission to build a commercial structure with two cellar floors, a ground floor, and four upper floors. However, it was revealed that the excavation work began without submitting the mandatory commencement notice, which is required to ensure compliance with safety regulations. GHMC officials had issued a precautionary notice on January 16, urging the developers to follow safety protocols during the excavation process.
Despite this, the owner/developer did not implement the necessary safety measures, leading to the deadly collapse. As a result, GHMC officials are holding the owner/developer accountable for their negligence, which directly contributed to the deaths. A criminal case is being filed against the developer for failing to adhere to safety rules and regulations, and there are discussions about the potential cancellation of the building's construction permit.
The incident has prompted an ongoing investigation, with police officials seeking further clarity into the situation and taking appropriate actions based on their findings.",,telangana,

The young women also reportedly tried to end their lives by cutting their wrists.
Police registered a case of death under suspicious circumstances and took up investigation. The house owner said the family had taken the house on rent two months ago. She said they kept two dogs chained inside the house. The owner said she had asked the family to vacate the house.
Police, however, said the reason for Sri Lalitha’s daughters staying with the body in the house would be known only after their statements were recorded.

She asserted that the state remains a 'prime destination' for investors.
Addressing the concluding session of the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS), Banerjee said that a total of 212 memoranda of understanding and letters of intent were signed across various sectors, underlining the state’s potential as an investment destination.
Banerjee said, ""We have received investment proposals amounting to Rs 4, 40,595 lakh crore during the two-day event. This will create thousands of job opportunities in West Bengal.""
The 'overwhelming response' to BGBS 2025 reflects Bengal’s ""growing economic potential,"" Banerjee stated. She emphasized her government's development efforts since 2011, noting that these initiatives have lifted 1.72 crore people above the poverty line in the state.
""Our continued focus on infrastructure, industry, and social welfare has yielded results,” she said.
In the 2023 edition of BGBS, Banerjee had said that West Bengal received investment proposals worth over Rs 3.76 lakh crore.
A key highlight of this year’s summit was the investment commitment from Reliance Industries, with its ChairmanMukesh Ambanipledging to invest Rs 50,000 crore in the state by the end of the decade.
""Today, in less than a decade, our investments in Bengal have increased 20 times, and we have invested over Rs 50,000 crore. Mamat Didi, we shall double this investment by the end of this decade.

The state government is aiming to tackle this growing issue by introducing hefty fines, significantly higher than the current penalties, which have long been seen as ineffective.
In a cabinet meeting held on Tuesday at the state secretariat, Nabanna, the West Bengal government decided to bring forward the legislation aimed at curbing public spitting, chewing tobacco, and pan masala, which has been causing a blot on the state’s public spaces. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee voiced her concern about the increasing trend of spitting in public places, especially on newly painted walls and footpaths, hindering the government's beautification efforts.
""People chewing gutkha and spitting on walls or public places is becoming a growing problem. This not only ruins the appearance of our infrastructure but also leads to unhygienic conditions,"" Banerjee said during the cabinet meeting. She also expressed her frustration over the state’s ongoing struggle to keep public spaces clean, with spitting becoming a common sight on fresh, newly painted walls.
The new bill proposes a significant increase in the fine for such offences, though the exact amount is yet to be finalised. Currently, under the West Bengal Prevention of Spitting in Public Places Act of 2003, a fine of 200 rupees is imposed. However, sources suggest that under the new bill, the fine could rise to 1,000 rupees per incident, marking at least a fivefold increase.
This move comes in response to growing public demand for stricter measures, as the existing penalty has been widely viewed as inadequate to deter such behaviours. While the fine amount is still under discussion, it’s clear that the state government is serious about addressing this issue.
The state’s budget session is set to begin on February 10, and Finance Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya will present the state’s budget on February 12, during which the new bill will likely be introduced. The upcoming legislative action signals the government’s commitment to improving public health and sanitation by taking a tough stand on tobacco-related public nuisances.
With this bold step, West Bengal hopes to set an example for other states grappling with similar issues, ultimately restoring dignity and cleanliness to its streets.",,west-bengal,

TMC MP Ritabrata Banerjee mentioned the matter during Zero Hour, highlighting that the West Bengal Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution in July 2018 to rename the state, yet the central government had not acted on it.
Banerjee noted that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, arguing that the renaming would align with the history, culture, and identity of the state, while also reflecting the aspirations of the people of Bengal. He emphasized that after the 1947 partition, the Indian side was named West Bengal, and the eastern part was known as East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh in 1971.
""Today, there is no East Pakistan,"" Banerjee pointed out, stressing the need to change the state's name in light of this historical shift.
The issue of renaming states is not new in India. The last time a state name was changed was in 2011 when Orissa became Odisha. Other cities, too, have undergone name changes, such as Bombay to Mumbai in 1995, Madras to Chennai in 1996, Calcutta to Kolkata in 2001, and Bangalore to Bengaluru in 2014.
The TMC’s demand for renaming West Bengal to 'Bangla' is seen as a reflection of the region's cultural identity, with supporters arguing that the new name would honour Bengal's history and its people’s aspirations. Banerjee also pointed out that the central government has yet to take any steps to honour the 2018 resolution passed by the West Bengal Assembly.
In addition to this issue, other matters were raised in the Rajya Sabha, including demands for national festival status for Odisha's Bali Jatra, cheaper ethanol for consumers, the dredging of the Barak River in Assam, and a call for better water conservation techniques to address flooding issues.",,west-bengal,

On Wednesday, the three members of the family, the victims—Sudeshna and Romi Dey, and Prasun Dey’s daughter—were found dead inside their Tangra residence. Few hours later, the two brothers and a boy from the family were injured in a car crash near a Metro Rail pillar.
Two brothers – Pranay and Prasun Dey – lived in that house in the eastern part of Kolkata with their wives Sudeshna and Romi, respectively. The brothers had, earlier, claimed to police that there was a suicide pact among the family members following which all consumed porridge laced with sleeping pills
""The autopsy conducted on the bodies of the two women, with wrists slit and deep injury marks on their throats, suggested that they died due to the effect of the injuries which were 'antemortem in nature. ' The minor girl died due to poisoning,"" the officer said.
The three injured have been undergoing treatment in a private hospital here. While Pranay was shifted to the state-run NRS Hospital, his brother Prasun and the juvenile son of Pranay are still undergoing treatment at the private facility.
""The health conditions of the two brothers and the boy, who were injured in the accident, were stated to have improved,"" the policeman said. The forensic team of Kolkata Police have collected samples from the bathroom, the washbasin, and rooms from where the bodies of the two women and the girl were found,"" the officer had said.

                                    Mahakumbh has turned into 'Mrityu Kumbh', claims Mamata Banerjee in Bengal Assembly",2025-02-18T15:35:43+05:30,"West Bengal Assembly Session:West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday sparked controversy by terming the 'Mahakumbh' as 'Mrityu Kumbh' in view of the recent incidents of stampede and alleged that the true death toll at the mega gathering has been suppressed.
At least 30 people died and 60 were injured in a stampede in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj last month while 18 people lost their lives in a recent stampede at the overcrowded New Delhi railway station.
Speaking in the West Bengal Assembly she said that for the rich and VIPs, facilities are available to book tents costing up to Rs1 lakh, however, for the poor, there are no proper arrangements at Kumbh.
""This is 'Mrityu Kumbh'. They (the BJP government) have hidden hundreds of bodies to bring down the toll. I respect Maha Kumbh, I respect the holy Ganga Maa. But there is no planning. How many people have been recovered? For the rich, the VIP, there are systems available to get camps (tents) for as high as Rs 1 lakh. For the poor, there are no arrangements at Kumbh. A stampede situation is common in a 'mela' but it is important to make arrangements. What planning did you make?"" said CM Banerjee.

Banerjee challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to prove allegations of her links with Bangladeshi fundamentalists, stating that she would resign if the party could substantiate the claims. The Chief Minister further said that she will complain to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about 'his MLAs' accusing her of 'being hand in glove with Bangladeshi fundamentalists'.
She said that BJP is using religion to serve its political interests, adding that the 'freedom of speech doesn't allow BJP MLAs to spread hatred and divide people'.
The Leader of the Opposition in West Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari, on Saturday, alleged that anti-national activities are high in some areas of the state and blamed Banerjee for them. ""There are some areas in Bengal where anti-national activities are high,"" news agency ANI quoted Adhikari telling reporters.
""In the last 2-3 months, many Bangladeshis, Rohingyas and extremists have been arrested by Assam Police and Jammu and Kashmir Police. There are 50-55 assembly constituencies and 30-35 police stations where the demography has changed... Mamata Banerjee is directly responsible for this. She has failed as a police minister (Home Minister) in Bengal,"" he added.

In response to the ongoing legal proceedings and court hearing, Kris Gopalakrishnan said on January 29, the Karnataka High Court stayed all further investigation and proceedings under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against him and others. ""As the matter is before the court, I will not comment further. I have full faith in the judiciary and trust that justice will prevail,"" said Gopalakrishnan. He added that he is also deeply pained as the law meant to protect the marginalised communities has been misused to make false allegations against him. ""I have always believed in fairness, justice, and treating everyone with respect, regardless of their background. I am deeply saddened that a law meant to protect marginalised communities has been misused to make false allegations against me,"" he said. He added that he has been associated with IISc as Chairman of the Council since 2022, while the alleged incidents date back to 2014.  He added that IISc has clear policies for fair and transparent investigations, which are within the purview of the executive management. Infosys co-founder and IISc Council Chairman Kris Gopalakrishnan, along with 17 faculty members, was booked under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act following allegations by a former professor regarding incidents from 2010 to 2020. The matter is under proceedings of the Karnataka High Court. The FIR was filed by the Sadashivanagar police following directions from the 71st City Civil and Sessions Court in Bengaluru. The complaint was lodged by D. Sanna Durgappa, a former professor at the Centre for Sustainable Technologies, IISc. The case has been filed against the Infosys Co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, Govindan Rangarajan, Sridhan Warrior, Anil Kumar, Namrata Gundaiah, Nirmala, Sandhya Vishwanath, Dishika Chakravarthy, Hari K.V.S., Dasappa, Balaram P., Balachandra P., Hemalatha Mhisi, Anjali A. Karande, Chattopadhyaya K., Pradeep S. Sawkar, Abhilash Raju, and Manoharan, all of whom are associated with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). The police have invoked Sections 3(8), 3(14), 3(1)(2), 3(x), 2(1), and 2(11) of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In his petition, Sanna Durgappa alleged that he was falsely implicated in a fabricated honey trap case, which led to his dismissal from IISc in 2014. He further claimed that the accused conspired to commit atrocities against him and insulted him based on his caste from 2008 to 2025. Durgappa claimed that IISc's Director had agreed to reinstate him, but this promise has not been fulfilled to date. He also alleged that the accused caused irreversible damage to his reputation, making it impossible for him to secure employment elsewhere in the country. The complainant alleged further harassment, including threats from ""hired rowdies"" when he sought justice. He stated that the woman involved in the alleged honey trap case had left the institution, yet IISc has not reconsidered his reinstatement. Even emails to the Union Minister for Education received misleading responses, he alleged. Durgappa also pointed out that while nearly 30 sexual harassment cases have been reported at IISc, none of the accused in those cases have been dismissed. He alleged misappropriation of approximately Rs 2,500 crore in SCSP and TSP funds (reserved for the welfare of SCs and STs) at IISc. Furthermore, he claimed that IISc's Director secured stay orders 15 times from the court and allegedly threatened him that judges could be booked to ensure a favourable verdict. The High Court bench headed by Justice S.R. Krishnakumar has issued an emergent notice to respondent number one, Dr. D. Sanna Durgappa, in the case. The bench asked to file objections and stated in the order: ""In the meanwhile, all further proceedings/investigation in the case and all further proceedings in the PCR, in so far as the petitioners are concerned, are hereby stayed till the next date of hearing.""

Right To Freedom Of Religion Cannot Be..: Allahabad High Court,"Jul 11, 2024 04:49 am IST","Denying bail to a person accused of carrying out illegal conversion, the Allahabad High Court has observed that the Constitution grants citizens the right to freely profess, practice and propagate their religion but it cannot be extended to construe a collective right to proselytise"" or convert other people to one's religion. The order was passed by Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal while rejecting the bail plea of Shriniwas Rav Nayak of Maharajganj who was booked under sections 3 and 5 (1) of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021. Passing the order, the court opined that the individual right to freedom of conscience, as guaranteed by the Constitution, ensures that every person has the liberty to choose, practice, and express their religious beliefs. However, the individual right to freedom of conscience and religion cannot be extended to construe a collective right to proselytize, which means attempting to convert others to one's religion, according to the court. ""The right to religious freedom belongs equally to the person converting and the individual sought to be converted,"" the court added. It is alleged that, on February 15, 2024, the informant in the case was invited to the house of Vishwanath where many villagers mostly from the Scheduled Castes community had gathered. Vishwanath's brother Brijlal, the applicant Shriniwas, and Ravindra were also present there.  They allegedly urged the informant to leave Hinduism and convert to Christianity, promising relief from pain and an improved life. While some villagers accepted Christianity and began praying, the informant escaped and reported the incident to the police. The counsel for the Shriniwas pleaded that he had no connection with the alleged conversion and that he was a domestic help of one of the co-accused, a resident of Andhra Pradesh, and had been falsely implicated in the case. It was also contended that no person who had converted to Christianity came forward to lodge a complaint. On the other hand, the state counsel submitted that a case under the anti-conversion Act of 2021 was made out against the applicant. He stated that the applicant came to Maharajganj where the conversion was taking place and was actively participating in the conversion from one religion to another which is against the law. The court in its decision on Tuesday noted that Section 3 of the 2021 Act clearly prohibits conversion from one religion to another based on misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, and allurement. In view of this, taking into account the allegations made against the accused, the court noted that the informant was persuaded to convert to another religion and this was prima facie sufficient to decline bail to the applicant as it established the fact that a conversion programme was going on and many villagers belonging to the Scheduled Castes community were being converted from Hinduism to Christianity.

Protests rocked Pithampur, around 50 km from the district headquarters, on Friday after toxic waste reached Ramky Enviro company, where the incineration is to be carried out.  The protests prompted the authorities to impose prohibitory orders under section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) banning the assembly of 50 or more persons around Ramky Enviro. Superintendent of Police (SP) Manoj Kumar Singh said five separate cases were registered on Friday night in connection with the protests for disrupting public peace. He said in some cases, people were named, while in others, first information reports (FIRs) were registered against unidentified persons. Singh said normalcy prevailed in Pithampur town on Saturday morning, and all industrial establishments were functioning. According to police, cases were registered at Pithampur Sector-1 police station under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) sections 283 (the exhibition of false lights, marks, or buoys with the intent to mislead navigators), 341 (possession of counterfeit any seal, plate or other instruments with intent of forgery), 149 (collection of men, arms, or ammunition with the intention of waging war against the Government of India), 147 (waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India), 285 (causing danger, obstruction or injury to any person in any public way), 126 (2) (intentional obstruction of a person's movement), 190 (unlawful assembly) and 191 (rioting). During the protests on Friday, a mob of 500-600 people marched to Ramky Group's Industrial Waste Management Private Limited premises, but the police dispersed them in time. Two persons attempted self-immolation during demonstrations in several parts of the town amid a bandh call given by Pithampur Bachao Samiti. However, the quick response of the crowd prevented a tragedy, and the men were admitted to a local hospital. Chief Minister Mohan Yadav chaired a high-level meeting on Friday night to review the situation and decided to apprise the courts about the latest position on the issue and not proceed until further court orders in the matter. He said the state government only transported the Union Carbide waste with safety parameters in compliance with the Supreme Court's instructions and the High Court's order. The court had given a deadline for the waste to reach the designated place before January 4, he added. Yadav took cognisance of the prevailing situation and said if any threat or sense of fear arises among the public about security, then the state government will try to present this subject before the court, and action will be taken only after this.

The three criminal laws -- Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam -- came into effect on July 1, replacing the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act, respectively. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation the successful implementation of three transformative new criminal laws -- ""Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam -- on December 3, at 12 noon at Chandigarh,"" said an official statement on Monday evening. The programme will showcase the practical application of these laws, demonstrating how they are already reshaping the criminal justice landscape. A live demonstration will also be held, simulating a crime scene investigation where the new laws will be put into action, the statement said. For the event, PM Modi will be accompanied by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, sources said. The Union Territory of Chandigarh has become fully compliant, with 100 per cent implementation of the laws. As part of security arrangements, police have deployed additional forces and set up multiple checkpoints while security has also been tightened in adjoining parts, including Panchkula and Mohali.  On Tuesday, traffic will remain restricted/diverted in Chandigarh on some routes, police said. According to the statement, the conceptualisation of the three laws was driven by the vision of the prime minister to remove colonial era laws which had continued to exist post Independence, and to transform the judicial system by shifting focus from punishment to justice. Keeping this in mind, the theme of this programme is 'Secure Society, Developed India - From Punishment to Justice', it said. The new criminal laws, which were implemented nationwide on July 1, 2024, aim to make India's legal system more transparent, efficient, and adaptable to the needs of contemporary society, it added. These landmark reforms mark a historic overhaul of India's criminal justice system, bringing in new frameworks to tackle modern-day challenges such as cybercrime, organized crime and ensuring justice for victims of various offenses, according to the statement. On August 4, Shah visited Chandigarh and launched the e-Sakshya, Nyay Setu, Nyay Shruti and e-Summon apps for the three new criminal laws. He had then said that the new laws would prove to be the ""biggest"" reform witnessed by India in the 21st century. After the complete implementation of these laws, India will have the most modern and technology-equipped criminal justice system in the world, he had said. Meanwhile, as part of security arrangements, authorities have declared a ""no-fly zone"" over Chandigarh from Monday till Tuesday for drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, according to an order issued by Deputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav. ""Movement of VVIPs is scheduled to Chandigarh on December 3. Therefore, in view of emerging threats due to recent trends of carrying out terrorist attacks by using drones fitted with improvised explosive device by anti-national elements and keeping in view of the security of VVIPs and general public, it becomes imperative to declare the area of Union Territory of Chandigarh as 'no-flying zone' for drones and unmanned aerial vehicles,"" the order said. The order will, however, not be applicable to law enforcement agencies and persons authorised by the competent government authority.

"Mystery Woman's Headless, Naked Body Found In UP, Triggers Massive Hunt","Sep 12, 2024 11:32 am IST","A woman's headless and naked body was found on the national highway at Gujaini in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur early yesterday, raising suspicion that she was raped, murdered and the body was thrown on the highway. Twenty-four hours later, police are yet to make a breakthrough and attempts to identify the woman are on. Police have scanned CCTV footage in the area to identify the woman. CCTV cameras at a hospital on the other side of the highway show a woman of similar build walking hours before the body was spotted on the highway. The woman in the footage is seen wearing grey trousers and shreds of a grey garment have been found near the body. Police have said the body was first spotted at 6.15 am yesterday. Three teams have been formed to investigate the matter. The police have said there are no CCTV cameras at the spot where the body was found, but a CCTV camera about 3 km away has captured visuals of a woman walking alone. The clothes the woman is seen wearing match the pieces of cloth and slippers found on the highway, police have said. Police are looking at the CCTV footage to spot any more clues. The body has been sent for post-mortem to confirm the cause of death. Police have found no complaint of a woman missing in the district that can be linked with the body recovered on the highway. Cops are now using frames for the CCTV footage to ask residents of the area if they have any information about the woman.  A forensic team has visited the spot and collected samples of teeth and bones for testing. A senior police officer said they are exploring if it is a case of accident or crime and are also trying to confirm if the victim was a local resident or was from somewhere else. Akhilesh Yadav, Lok Sabha MP and chief of UP's main Opposition Samajwadi Party, has demanded exemplary action in the chilling case. ""In another shocking case of crime against women, a woman's headless, naked body was found on a highway in Kanpur. The matter should be investigated fairly and such punishment should be meted out so that criminals get scared and such incidents are not repeated,"" Mr Yadav said, hoping that the BJP-led state government would ""rise above politics"" and investigate the incident.",india-news,,india
"More Than Half Of Kolkata's Iconic Yellow Taxis To Be Off Roads In 2025, Here's Why","Dec 23, 2024 15:01 pm IST","Over 64 per cent of the iconic yellow taxis in Kolkata will be off the roads by March 2025 due to the 15-year service limit imposed by the state transport department. As per records of the state transport department currently there are around 7,000 registered yellow taxis in the state. Out of them around 4,500 will have to be taken off the roads as per pollution norms that bars vehicles of 15 years old or above from moving on the roads. These yellow taxis, all Ambassadors, were earlier produced by Hindustan Motors Limited (HML) at the company's manufacturing unit, Hind Motor in the Hooghly district of West Bengal.  However, since the company has stopped manufacturing this particular brand there is no chance of their replacements. ALSO READ |Kolkata's Trams: How City's 151-Year-Old ""Glory"" Is Dying A Slow Death There is confusion on the exact year when the yellow taxis were for the first time introduced on the roads of Kolkata. Some records of the state transports say that probably 1908 was the year when the first yellow taxi started operating on the streets of Kolkata with the per-mile cost for availing its service being fixed at 50 paise. However, the Calcutta Tax Association adopted Ambassador as the Standard Tax Model in 1962. Clear visibility of the colour even after the sunset was the reason for choosing yellow as the colour of the taxis The popularity of yellow taxis has been down for quite a few years now because of the introduction of the app cabs that provide better comfort rides. However, considering the nostalgia associated with the yellow taxis the state transport department is trying to work out a formula to keep that reminiscence alive to an extent and as far as possible. ""Getting Ambassador models back on the streets is out of the question since the company manufacturing it has stopped the production of this brand now. However, the owners holding the permits of old yellow taxis will be able to get new commercial transport permits against the old ones. Thereafter any owner, he or she, whoever wants to get yellow as the colour for that commercial vehicle would be allowed to do that by virtue of special permission from the state transport department. However, all these are at the drawing-board stage now and need discussions with the taxi associations,"" said an official of the state transport department.

Kerala Orders Probe Into Dowry Harassment On Newly-Wed Woman,"May 15, 2024 07:17 am IST","A bride in this north Kerala district has accused her husband of brutally assaulting and attempting to kill her over dowry, barely a week after their wedding on May 5. The Kerala State Human Rights Commission has registered a case on its own and ordered an investigation. The details of the assault came out after the newly-wed woman and her family told TV channels that the police at Pantheerankavu, where the husband lives, tried to settle the case instead of taking their complaint seriously. As news of the alleged assault spread, State Minister of Health and Women and Child Development Veena George said that the victim will be provided with all support, including legal assistance. In a statement, the minister said that as soon as the issue came to her attention, she instructed the Director of the Women and Child Development Department to conduct an investigation. Terming the assault on the newly-married woman extremely cruel and stating that it shocks the conscience, the minister said strong legal action will be taken to prevent people from perpetrating such crimes, and recommended that society unite against social evils such as dowry and domestic violence.  Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly V D Satheesan criticised the police inaction in the case, and asked whether it stands with the victim or the perpetrators. In a statement, Mr Satheesan said the police behaved indifferently in the case and, therefore, he requested the Kozhikode City Police Commissioner to take action in the case, who in turn assured him that all necessary steps will be taken. Mr Satheesan said it was ""unbelievable"" that the woman was brutally beaten over dowry within a week of marriage. He said that the woman was so badly beaten up that ""even her parents could not recognise her"", and emphasised that such incidents cannot be allowed in the state. ""Such incidents humiliate Kerala and cannot be tolerated,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Kerala State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC) registered a case on its own and ordered an investigation into the woman's complaint of domestic violence. In a statement, the Commission said that the action was taken based on the interviews given by the woman to TV channels. Acting Chairperson and Judicial Member of the KSHRC K Byjunath directed the Kozhikode City Police Commissioner to conduct a detailed investigation and submit a report within 15 days. Earlier in the day, the victim told TV channels that her husband brutally assaulted her and then tried to strangle her using a mobile phone charging cable. She alleged that the assault came after an argument between them over dowry. ""Right before marriage we had told the groom's family what we could give and he (husband) had said he was okay with that. Now he claims that he deserves more dowry and also a car,"" she alleged. The bride's mother said that when the family went to meet her at the matrimonial home, they noticed several injuries on her face and on being asked, she told them that her husband had beaten her. The family also accused the local police of being friendly towards the husband and trying to settle the case, instead of taking action against him.
